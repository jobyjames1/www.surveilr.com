### 1. Project Overview

This project defines a repeatable and automated functional testing process for the **Surveilr CLI**.  
The primary goals are to ensure reliable **command execution**, accurate **file ingestion and transformation**, and robust **error handling**.  
This project adds value by reducing deployment risks, ensuring consistent behavior across environments, and providing traceable validation of all core CLI functionalities.

---

### 2. Scope

The scope of this project includes **functional validation of the Surveilr Command-Line Interface** with emphasis on:  
- Correct execution of CLI commands and subcommands  
- Accurate ingestion and parsing of supported file types  
- Validation of output consistency and logs  
- Verification of error handling and user feedback for negative scenarios  

The project excludes performance, security, and UI testing, which are handled by separate initiatives.

### 3. Key Testing Areas

#### 3.1 Functional CLI Testing
- Validate all core CLI commands and subcommands.  
- Ensure proper handling of command parameters, flags, and options.  
- Validate exit codes, standard output, and log messages for success and failure scenarios.  

#### 3.2 File Ingestion & Transformation Validation
- Test ingestion of supported file types to ensure accurate parsing and processing.  
- **Supported file types include:**
  - **Structured Data Files:** JSON (.json), YAML/YML (.yaml, .yml), XML (.xml), CSV (.csv)  
  - **Text Files:** Plain text (.txt), Markdown (.md), Rich Text (.rtf)  
  - **Office Documents:** Word (.doc, .docx), Excel (.xls, .xlsx), PowerPoint (.ppt, .pptx), PDF (.pdf)  
  - **Diagram / Design Files:** PlantUML (.puml), SVG (.svg), Visio (.vsd, .vsdx)  
  - **Code / Script Files:** Source code (.py, .js, .ts, .java, .cpp, .c), Shell scripts (.sh, .bat), Config files (.ini, .cfg)  
  - **Miscellaneous Files:** Logs (.log), Compressed archives (.zip, .tar, .gz), Images (.png, .jpg, .jpeg)  
  - **Real-World Data Files:**
    - Emails (.eml, .msg)  
    - Project management exports (Jira, GitHub, Trello, Asana)  
    - CRM exports (Salesforce, HubSpot)  
    - ERP exports (SAP, Oracle)  
    - Healthcare EHR exports and related structured data files  
- Validate output consistency using metrics like row counts, metadata extraction, and logs.  
- Ensure correct handling of configuration files and structured data across ingestion processes.  

#### 3.3 Error Handling & Negative Scenarios
- Test invalid file paths, unsupported formats, incorrect flags, and missing arguments.  
- Verify graceful failure, proper error messages, and correct exit codes.  
- Ensure the CLI provides actionable feedback without unexpected termination.
