### 1. Project Overview

The **Surveilr Data Ingestion and CLI Functional Validation** project focuses on ensuring that Surveilr’s command-line interface and ingestion mechanisms operate reliably and consistently across multiple environments and data sources.  
It validates ingestion accuracy, error resilience, and synchronization reliability for structured, unstructured, and multimedia data.

**Key Objectives:**
- Verify command execution, parameters, and flag handling within Surveilr’s CLI.  
- Ensure ingestion workflows process and analyze diverse data formats accurately.  
- Validate web-based and multimedia ingestion, including HTML, RSS, APIs, JPEG, PNG, MP3, and MP4 files.  
- Test error handling, logging, and recovery for unreachable or invalid data sources.  
- Confirm seamless integration with third-party systems such as GitLab, GitHub, Jira, Azure, AWS, and GCP.  

**Business Value:**  
This project enhances automation reliability, reduces ingestion failures, and supports continuous compliance and data-driven operations within the Surveilr ecosystem.

### 2. Scope

The project covers end-to-end validation of Surveilr’s CLI, data ingestion, and synchronization subsystems.  
It ensures accurate processing of structured, unstructured, and multimedia content while maintaining system reliability, security, and performance under real-world workloads.

#### Key Focus Areas

- **Functional CLI Testing**  
  - Validate CLI command execution, flag handling, and expected outputs.  
  - Ensure consistent behavior across success and failure conditions.  
  - Verify exit codes, logging accuracy, and help documentation.  

- **Email Ingestion (IMAP)**  
  - Validate secure retrieval and parsing of IMAP emails.  
  - Ensure attachments and metadata are correctly processed.  

- **Structured & Archived File Ingestion**  
  - Test ingestion of CSV, JSON, XML, and YAML/YML formats.  
  - Validate extraction and processing from ZIP and TAR.GZ archives.  

- **Office Document Management**  
  - Validate ingestion and parsing of DOC/DOCX, XLS/XLSX, PPT/PPTX, and PDF files.  
  - Confirm metadata and content extraction accuracy.  

- **Text-Based File Handling**  
  - Ensure proper ingestion of TXT, MD, and RTF files.  
  - Verify indexing and content parsing integrity.  

- **Web-Based Content Ingestion**  
  - Validate ingestion of HTML pages, RSS feeds, and Web API sources.  
  - Ensure proper handling of unreachable, invalid, or malformed URLs.  
  - Confirm retry logic, timeout handling, and error resilience.  
  - Verify metadata extraction, tagging, and indexing of ingested content.  

- **Multimedia File Ingestion**  
  - Validate ingestion, upload, and metadata extraction for JPEG, PNG, MP3, and MP4 files.  
  - Assess performance during concurrent multimedia uploads.  
  - Ensure resilience against corrupt or oversized media files.  

- **Third-Party System Synchronization**  
  - Verify data ingestion and sync with GitLab, GitHub, Jira, Azure, AWS, OpenProject, and GCP.
