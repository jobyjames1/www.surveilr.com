### 1. Project Overview

The **Surveilr Data Ingestion and CLI Functional Validation** project focuses on verifying the reliability and consistency of Surveilr’s command-line and ingestion capabilities.  
It ensures that Surveilr’s CLI handles command execution, parameters, flags, exit codes, and logging as expected, while validating ingestion, parsing, and synchronization of multiple file types and third-party platforms.

This project provides comprehensive assurance that:
- The CLI behaves predictably across success and failure conditions.  
- Ingestion and parsing workflows handle diverse formats (CSV, JSON, XML, ZIP/TAR.GZ, DOCX, XLSX, PDF, TXT, MD, RTF) accurately.  
- Email (IMAP) ingestion is stable, secure, and properly processed.  
- Synchronization with third-party task management platforms maintains data integrity and consistency.  

**Business Value:**  
Ensures operational stability, supports data-driven insights, enhances automation reliability, and reduces ingestion errors across Surveilr’s ecosystem.

### 2. Scope

The project encompasses functional and integration testing of Surveilr’s ingestion, CLI, and synchronization subsystems. It covers command validation, multi-format data ingestion, structured and unstructured data analysis, and external system integrations.

#### Key Focus Areas

- **Functional CLI Testing**  
  - Validate command execution, flag handling, and output accuracy.  
  - Verify exit codes, logging behavior, and error reporting.  

- **Email Ingestion (IMAP)**  
  - Validate secure retrieval, parsing, and processing of IMAP emails.  
  - Ensure correct handling of attachments and message metadata.  

- **Capturable Executable (CE) File Ingestion**  
  - Confirm proper upload, recognition, and processing of CE files.  
  - Validate logging, storage, and analysis consistency.  

- **Structured and Archived File Ingestion**  
  - Validate ingestion and parsing of CSV, JSON, YAML/YML, XML formats.  
  - Ensure extraction and analysis from ZIP and TAR.GZ archives.  

- **Office Document Management**  
  - Test ingestion, parsing, and data extraction from DOC/DOCX, XLS/XLSX, PPT/PPTX, and PDF files.  

- **Text-based File Handling**  
  - Validate ingestion of TXT, MD, and RTF files.  
  - Confirm correct parsing and content indexing.  

- **Third-Party Task Synchronization**  
  - Verify ingestion and sync from GitLab, GitHub, Xray, Jira, Azure, AWS, OpenProject, and GCP.  
  - Validate mapping consistency, performance, and error handling.

### 3. Quality Goals

- **Reliability:** Maintain consistent ingestion and execution outcomes across multiple file types and command variations.  
- **Performance:** Optimize ingestion speed, email processing, and synchronization latency.  
- **Security:** Ensure secure handling of sensitive data and credentials during ingestion and CLI operations.  
- **Scalability:** Validate handling of concurrent ingestion requests and bulk data processing.  
- **Interoperability:** Guarantee seamless connectivity with external task management and cloud systems.
