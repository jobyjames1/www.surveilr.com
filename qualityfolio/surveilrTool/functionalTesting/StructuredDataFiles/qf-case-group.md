## Overview

The **Data File Handling** group ensures that Surveilr can correctly handle common structured data formats used for configuration, logs, or tabular data. These test cases validate that files can be ingested, parsed, and analyzed without data loss or errors.

## Key Functional Areas

### ðŸ”¹ CSV (.csv) â€“ Comma-Separated Values

- Ensure CSV files with headers and multiple rows are parsed correctly.
- Validate proper handling of commas, quotes, and escape characters.
- Confirm numeric, string, and date values are correctly interpreted.
- Verify error handling for malformed or empty CSV files.

### ðŸ”¹ JSON (.json) â€“ Structured Objects, Configurations, and Logs

- Ensure JSON files are parsed into correct key-value structures.
- Validate nested objects and arrays are correctly interpreted.
- Confirm Surveilr handles invalid or missing fields gracefully.
- Verify proper logging of errors for corrupted JSON files.

### ðŸ”¹ YAML / YML (.yaml, .yml) â€“ Configuration Files

- Ensure YAML files load correctly, including nested maps and sequences.
- Validate handling of anchors, aliases, and multi-line strings.
- Confirm proper error messages for invalid indentation or syntax.
- Test reading and parsing of multiple YAML documents in a single file.

### ðŸ”¹ XML (.xml) â€“ Structured Markup Data

- Ensure XML files with nested elements and attributes are parsed correctly.
- Validate proper handling of namespaces, CDATA sections, and special characters.
- Confirm errors are raised for malformed XML and missing closing tags.
- Test integration with Surveilr analytics for structured data extraction.

### ðŸ”¹ General File Handling

- Verify files are accepted only with correct extensions (.csv, .json, .yaml, .yml, .xml).
- Ensure proper error messages for unsupported file types.
- Validate system performance when processing large files.
- Confirm accurate storage and retrieval for reporting or further analysis.
