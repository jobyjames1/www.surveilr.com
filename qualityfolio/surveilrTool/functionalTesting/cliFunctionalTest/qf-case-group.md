## Overview

The **Functional CLI Testing** group ensures that Surveilr's command-line interface behaves as expected. These test cases validate command execution, proper handling of parameters and flags, accurate exit codes, and reliable logging for both success and failure scenarios.

## Key Functional Areas

### ðŸ”¹ Core CLI Commands

- Validate execution of critical commands.
- Ensure commands run successfully with expected outcomes.
- Confirm error handling for invalid command usage.

### ðŸ”¹ Parameter and Flag Handling

- Verify correct parsing of CLI parameters and flags.
- Test optional and mandatory flags for different commands.
- Validate behavior when invalid or unsupported options are provided.

### ðŸ”¹ Exit Codes

- Confirm that commands return standard exit codes for success and failure.
- Test for proper exit codes in error scenarios, including missing files or invalid formats.
- Ensure scripts and automation can reliably detect command outcomes based on exit codes.

### ðŸ”¹ Log Outputs

- Verify that logs are generated for each command execution.
- Confirm logs capture errors, warnings, and success messages.
- Validate consistency of log formats for automated monitoring or debugging.
