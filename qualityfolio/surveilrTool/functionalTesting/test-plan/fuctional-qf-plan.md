The testing ensures the Surveilr CLI executes commands accurately, processes files reliably, maintains consistent behavior across Dev, QA, and Staging environments, captures outputs and logs correctly, and integrates with Qualityfolio for automated review and tracking.

## Scope of Work

The testing will cover the following key activities:

### Functional CLI Testing

Command Execution

- Validate execution of core CLI commands, including `ingest files` and environment-specific workflows.
- Ensure proper handling of parameters, flags, and options for each command.
- Verify command exit codes reflect success or failure correctly.
- Test log outputs for accuracy and completeness.

File Ingestion & Transformation

- Validate ingestion and parsing of supported file types (JSON, YAML, XML, CSV, PDF, DOCX, etc.).
- Confirm output consistency through row counts, metadata extraction, and structured logs.
- Test handling of configuration and structured data files.

Error Handling & Negative Scenarios

- Test invalid file paths, unsupported formats, missing arguments, and incorrect flags.
- Confirm graceful failure, appropriate exit codes, and meaningful error messages.
- Validate recovery mechanisms where applicable.

Multi-Environment Execution

- Run CLI commands across Dev, QA, and Staging to verify consistent outputs.
- Ensure environment-specific configurations are correctly applied.
- Confirm processing integrity and data consistency across environments.

Automation & CI/CD Integration

- Validate CLI scripts can be automated using batch/shell/PowerShell scripts.
- Test triggering of functional tests via CI/CD pipelines or release tags.
- Ensure automatic capturing of outputs, logs, and validation results.

Qualityfolio Integration & Reporting

- Confirm automated upload of results to Qualityfolio for PASS/FAIL marking.
- Verify assignment of review tasks to QA resources.
- Validate traceability of test results and resolution of gaps before release.

Performance & Resilience

- Test CLI behavior under simulated concurrent executions or high-load scenarios.
- Confirm stability and correctness of outputs during multi-user operations.
- Validate that error handling does not interrupt subsequent processing steps.
