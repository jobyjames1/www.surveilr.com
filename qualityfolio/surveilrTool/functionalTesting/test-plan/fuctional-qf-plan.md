## 1. Introduction

This test plan defines the overall strategy and approach for validating the **Surveilr Command-Line Interface (CLI)**.  
The focus is on **functional correctness, file ingestion, output consistency, and error handling** to ensure predictable CLI behavior across multiple environments.  

**Objectives include:**  
- Ensuring all CLI commands execute as expected.  
- Verifying accurate ingestion and transformation of supported file types.  
- Confirming correct handling of command parameters, flags, and options.  
- Validating proper exit codes, logs, and error messages.  
- Ensuring reliable feedback for negative or invalid scenarios.

## 2. Scope of Work

The testing will cover:  

- **Functional Testing:**  
  - Validate all core CLI commands, parameters, and flags.  
  - Verify exit codes, logs, and output messages for success and failure.  

- **File Ingestion & Transformation Validation:**  
  - Test ingestion of supported file types:  
    - **Structured Data:** JSON, YAML/YML, XML, CSV  
    - **Text Files:** TXT, MD, RTF  
    - **Office Documents:** DOC/DOCX, XLS/XLSX, PPT/PPTX, PDF  
    - **Diagram/Design Files:** PlantUML, SVG, Visio  
    - **Code/Script Files:** Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C/C++, Shell, Configs  
    - **Miscellaneous:** Logs, archives (ZIP/TAR/GZ), images  
    - **Real-World Data:** Emails, project management exports, CRM exports, ERP exports, Healthcare EHR files  
  - Validate output consistency, row counts, metadata extraction, and logs.  

- **Error Handling & Negative Scenarios:**  
  - Test invalid paths, unsupported formats, incorrect flags, and missing arguments.  
  - Verify graceful failure, proper error messages, and actionable feedback.  

**Out of Scope:**  
- Performance/load testing  
- Security or penetration testing  
- UI/UX testing (CLI has no graphical interface)

## 3. Test Objectives

- Validate functional correctness of all CLI commands and modules.  
- Confirm integrity of file ingestion and data transformation processes.  
- Verify robust error handling and appropriate exit codes.  
- Ensure analytics/logging captures correct execution details.  
- Validate fallback mechanisms and failure recovery.

## 4. Test Approach

### 4.1 Functional Testing
- Execute CLI commands using various parameters and flags.  
- Validate standard output, logs, and exit codes.  
- Confirm integration with dependent services (if any).  
- Verify exception handling and error messages for invalid inputs.  

### 4.2 File Ingestion & Transformation
- Feed supported and real-world file types to the CLI.  
- Validate correct parsing, processing, and output consistency.  
- Check handling of configuration files and structured data.  

### 4.3 Error Handling & Negative Scenarios
- Execute commands with invalid paths, flags, and missing arguments.  
- Confirm proper error reporting and graceful termination.  
- Validate CLI provides actionable feedback to guide users.
