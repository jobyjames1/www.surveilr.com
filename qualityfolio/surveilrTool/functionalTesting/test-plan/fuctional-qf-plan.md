## 1. Introduction

This test plan outlines the testing strategy for validating the **Surveilr** platform’s **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** and **data ingestion subsystems**.  
The testing focuses on verifying reliability, correctness, and robustness of command executions, data ingestion pipelines, structured/unstructured file processing, and external platform synchronizations.

**Objectives include:**  
- Ensuring CLI commands execute correctly and return accurate exit codes.  
- Validating ingestion and parsing of diverse file formats (CSV, JSON, XML, DOCX, PDF, TXT, etc.).  
- Verifying IMAP email ingestion and attachment processing workflows.  
- Confirming synchronization accuracy with third-party task platforms like GitHub, GitLab, Jira, and Azure.  
- Assessing data consistency, error-handling, and logging reliability across modules.

## 2. Scope of Work

The scope covers the end-to-end **functional validation** and **data ingestion testing** of Surveilr’s CLI and processing pipelines.

### In-Scope Activities
- **Functional Testing:**  
  Validate CLI command operations, parameter handling, and output responses.  
  Ensure ingestion, parsing, and transformation logic function as designed.  

- **Data Ingestion Validation:**  
  Confirm correct ingestion of structured (CSV, JSON, XML, YAML) and unstructured (DOCX, PDF, TXT) files.  
  Test archive extraction (ZIP, TAR.GZ) and Capturable Executable (CE) file processing.  

- **IMAP Email Workflow Testing:**  
  Validate secure email retrieval, metadata parsing, and attachment ingestion.  

- **Third-Party Synchronization:**  
  Test task synchronization and mapping from GitHub, GitLab, Jira, Xray, Azure, AWS, and GCP.  
  Verify data consistency and synchronization status reporting.  

- **Logging and Error Handling:**  
  Ensure consistent and traceable logging for both success and failure scenarios.  
  Validate meaningful error messages and system stability under failure conditions.  

### Out of Scope
- Performance, stress, and scalability testing.  
- Security penetration or vulnerability assessment.  
- SLA validation for external third-party services.  

---

## 3. Test Objectives

- Verify correctness and reliability of CLI commands and ingestion processes.  
- Confirm data integrity during ingestion, transformation, and synchronization.  
- Validate system responses to malformed, missing, or corrupted data inputs.  
- Ensure synchronization workflows maintain accuracy across integrations.  
- Validate all test outcomes are logged, traceable, and reproducible.

## 4. Test Approach

### 4.1 Functional Testing
- Validate CLI command syntax, parameters, and expected output messages.  
- Execute functional flows covering ingestion, parsing, and logging validation.  
- Use automation with **Playwright** and **TypeScript** for consistent regression testing.  
- Ensure proper exception handling for invalid inputs or command misuse.  

### 4.2 Data Ingestion Testing
- Upload and validate diverse file formats: CSV, JSON, XML, DOCX, PDF, TXT, ZIP/TAR.GZ.  
- Confirm accurate extraction, parsing, and metadata capture for each format.  
- Test bulk ingestion scenarios and verify consistent indexing results.  

### 4.3 IMAP Email Processing
- Validate successful IMAP connection, email fetching, and ingestion.  
- Ensure attachments are properly captured and parsed.  
- Verify duplicate handling, mailbox polling intervals, and failure recovery.  

### 4.4 Third-Party Integration Testing
- Connect Surveilr with GitHub, GitLab, Jira, Azure, AWS, and GCP test accounts.  
- Trigger synchronization jobs and verify data mapping accuracy.  
- Confirm consistent task ingestion across multiple refresh cycles.  

### 4.5 Logging and Error Handling
- Review CLI and ingestion logs for completeness and accuracy.  
- Validate that error messages are descriptive and aligned with Surveilr standards.  
- Ensure logs capture command context, timestamps, and failure traces.
