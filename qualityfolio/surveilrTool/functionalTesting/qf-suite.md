## Scope of Work

This test suite validates the **functional correctness of the Surveilr CLI**.  
It covers:  
- Execution of core CLI commands and subcommands.  
- Handling of parameters, flags, and options.  
- File ingestion and transformation for supported and real-world data files.  
- Output validation, logging, and exit codes.  
- Error handling and negative scenarios.  

The suite ensures predictable behavior across environments and aligns with business, technical, and compliance requirements.

## Test Objectives

- Validate command execution for all supported CLI commands.  
- Ensure accurate ingestion and parsing of supported file types (JSON, CSV, XML, YAML, Office files, logs, scripts, images, emails, and real-world exports).  
- Confirm logs, standard output, and exit codes reflect correct operation and failures.  
- Test negative scenarios such as invalid paths, unsupported formats, incorrect flags, and missing arguments.  
- Verify feedback to the user is actionable and clear.  
- Assess CLI behavior across multiple environments and inputs.
