## Scope of Work

This test suite is developed to assess whether Surveilr CLI meets functional expectations prior to deployment. It includes scenario-based testing across Dev, QA, and Staging environments, focusing on **command reliability**, **input/output integrity**, **error resilience**, and **automation readiness**.

## Test Objectives

- Validate core CLI commands, including `ingest files` and environment-specific workflows
- Ensure CLI parameters, flags, and options are processed correctly
- Confirm command exit codes and logs reflect accurate success/failure states
- Test ingestion and parsing of supported file types (JSON, YAML, XML, CSV, PDF, etc.)
- Verify output consistency via row counts, metadata extraction, and structured logs
- Test negative scenarios: invalid file paths, unsupported formats, missing arguments
- Confirm multi-environment execution produces consistent results across Dev, QA, and Staging
- Assess automated execution via batch/shell/PowerShell scripts and CI/CD triggers
- Validate integration with Qualityfolio for automated PASS/FAIL recording and review assignment
- Ensure CLI resilience under simulated multi-user or high-load operations
