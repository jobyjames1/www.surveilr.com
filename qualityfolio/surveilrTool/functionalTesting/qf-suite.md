## Scope of Work

This test suite is designed to validate the **functional CLI behavior** and **multi-source ingestion workflows** of the Surveilr platform.  
It covers command execution, structured/unstructured data processing, IMAP email ingestion, and integration synchronization.  
The goal is to ensure end-to-end reliability, data consistency, and operational correctness across Surveilr’s ingestion pipeline and automation modules.

### Key Focus Areas
- Functional CLI execution and flag handling  
- Structured file ingestion (CSV, JSON, YAML, XML)  
- Office and document ingestion (DOCX, XLSX, PDF, PPTX)  
- Text file ingestion (TXT, MD, RTF)  
- Archive handling (ZIP, TAR.GZ)  
- IMAP email ingestion and parsing  
- Capturable Executable (CE) ingestion validation  
- Synchronization with third-party systems (GitHub, GitLab, Jira, Azure, AWS, OpenProject, GCP)  
- Logging and error trace validation for all ingestion workflows  

---

## Test Objectives

- Validate CLI command behavior under different parameters and execution contexts.  
- Ensure ingestion pipelines process all supported file formats accurately.  
- Confirm extraction, parsing, and indexing of document content are complete and error-free.  
- Validate IMAP connectivity, attachment ingestion, and duplicate prevention.  
- Verify synchronization data mapping accuracy between Surveilr and integrated platforms.  
- Confirm system logs and CLI outputs are accurate, traceable, and consistent.  
- Evaluate ingestion performance under typical operational loads.  
- Ensure proper handling of invalid, corrupted, or unsupported files.  
- Maintain compliance and security standards during data transfer and processing.

## Roles & Responsibilities

- **Test Lead:**  
  - Oversee test suite planning and execution.  
  - Validate test coverage alignment with project objectives.  
  - Review and approve test results and reports.  

- **Test Engineers:**  
  - Execute CLI, ingestion, and synchronization test cases.  
  - Record results, log defects, and retest after fixes.  
  - Verify logging and reporting accuracy.  

- **Developers (Support Role):**  
  - Provide technical clarifications on ingestion workflows.  
  - Resolve reported issues and participate in triage sessions.  

- **Stakeholders / Reviewers:**  
  - Review execution results, validate key functionality outcomes, and provide final sign-off.  

---

## Execution Strategy

- Test execution will be carried out using **Playwright (TypeScript)** for CLI and web-based validation where applicable.  
- Test data will include structured (CSV, JSON, XML), unstructured (DOCX, PDF, TXT), and archived datasets (ZIP, TAR.GZ).  
- Integration testing will utilize sandbox credentials for connected platforms.  
- Results will be documented with detailed logs, timestamps, and validation screenshots (if applicable).  

---

## Deliverables

- Executed test case results in JSON format  
- CLI command validation logs  
- IMAP ingestion reports  
- Structured/unstructured data ingestion summaries  
- Integration synchronization test results  
- Final suite summary report and sign-off record  

---

## Dependencies

- Surveilr CLI and ingestion modules configured in test environment  
- Access to IMAP-enabled email account  
- Integration credentials for GitHub, GitLab, Jira, Azure, AWS, and GCP  
- Test data files across all supported formats  
- Playwright automation framework setup
