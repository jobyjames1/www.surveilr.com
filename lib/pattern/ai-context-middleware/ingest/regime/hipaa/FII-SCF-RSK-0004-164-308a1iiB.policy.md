# Risk Management Process Compliance Policy

## Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to establish a comprehensive framework for completing the risk management process in accordance with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) guidelines. This policy aims to ensure that all risk assessments are conducted, documented, and validated consistently, thereby enhancing the organization's ability to manage and mitigate risks effectively.

## Policy Sections

### Risk Management Process Requirement
The organization is required to complete a risk management process that aligns with NIST guidelines. This includes identifying, assessing, and responding to risks to the organization’s assets, individuals, and operations.

- **Machine Attestation Methods:**
  - Utilize automated tools to collect risk assessment data and verify completion status. For instance, system logs should be leveraged to confirm that risk assessments are conducted at defined intervals.
  
- **Human Attestation Methods:**
  - In situations where automation is impractical, managerial sign-off on risk management documentation is required. Managers must review and approve all risk assessments to ensure compliance with established protocols.

### Evidence Collection Methods
- **Explanation of Requirement:**
  - A documented risk management process is essential for compliance and accountability. It serves as a record of risk assessments and the organization’s response strategies.
  
- **Machine Attestation Approach:**
  - Evidence of risk assessments must be collected and verified automatically. For example, risk assessment reports should be ingested into the Surveilr platform for validation and compliance tracking.
  
- **Human Attestation (if unavoidable):**
  - When automated methods cannot be employed, risk assessment documentation must be completed and signed by relevant personnel to ensure accountability.

### Verification Criteria
To validate compliance with this policy, the following measurable criteria must be adhered to:
- Risk assessments must be completed quarterly, with comprehensive reports submitted for review to the Compliance Officer.
- Any identified risks must be documented, along with the corresponding mitigation strategies and follow-up actions.

## Responsibilities
The following roles are responsible for specific tasks within the risk management process:
- **Compliance Officer:** Review risk management reports quarterly and ensure adherence to policy requirements.
- **IT Security:** Conduct bi-annual risk assessments, document findings, and facilitate the review process.
- **Management:** Provide oversight and sign-off on risk assessment documentation.

## Policy Lifecycle Requirements
- All risk assessment documentation must be retained for a minimum of six years to comply with regulatory requirements and organizational standards.
- This policy must be reviewed and updated at least annually to ensure its effectiveness and relevance to current practices.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members are required to acknowledge their understanding and compliance with this policy. Additionally, comprehensive audit logging must be implemented for all critical actions related to the risk management process, ensuring traceability and accountability.
