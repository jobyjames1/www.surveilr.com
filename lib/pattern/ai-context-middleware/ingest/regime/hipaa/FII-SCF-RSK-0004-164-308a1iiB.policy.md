# HIPAA Compliance Policy Document

## Introduction
This policy establishes the framework for ensuring that the risk management process is conducted in accordance with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) guidelines, as required by HIPAA control code 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(B). The purpose of this policy is to uphold the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of protected health information (PHI) through effective risk management.

## Policy Statement
The organization is committed to completing a comprehensive risk management process that adheres to NIST guidelines. This process will be regularly validated and documented to ensure compliance and to mitigate potential risks to PHI.

## Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party service providers who manage, handle, or have access to PHI within the organization. It encompasses all activities related to the risk management process as stipulated in NIST guidelines.

## Responsibilities
- **Risk Management Officer**: Responsible for overseeing the risk management process and ensuring compliance with NIST guidelines.
- **Compliance Team**: Responsible for the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence using Surveilr.
- **IT Security Team**: Responsible for implementing machine attestation methods and ensuring technical controls are in place.
- **Management**: Responsible for human attestation where automation is not feasible.

## Evidence Collection Methods

### Explanation
The organization will utilize both machine and human attestation to verify the completion of the risk management process. This ensures a robust and reliable evidence collection strategy in compliance with HIPAA and NIST guidelines.

### Machine Attestation
- **Procedure**: Utilize Surveilr to automatically ingest and analyze assessment data related to the risk management process.
- **Implementation**: 
  - Endpoint configurations will be validated using `OSquery` to ensure compliance with established security standards.
  - API integrations with SaaS/cloud providers will be monitored to ensure that risk assessments are conducted and documented.
  - Automated scripts will be used to collect logs and configuration data to verify that the risk management process has been followed.

### Human Attestation (if unavoidable)
- **Procedure**: In instances where automated attestation is not feasible, human attestation will be employed.
- **Implementation**: 
  - The Risk Management Officer must sign the completed risk management report, certifying its accuracy.
  - The signed report must be uploaded to Surveilr along with relevant metadata (reviewer, date, outcome) for future querying.

## Verification Criteria
The completion of the risk management process will be verified through:
- Successful ingestion of relevant assessment data into Surveilr.
- Signed documentation from the Risk Management Officer confirming the process completion.
- Audit logs from the Surveilr system indicating compliance evidence collection.

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the Risk Management Officer. Exceptions may include scenarios where machine attestation methods are impractical or where human attestation is necessary due to specific operational constraints.
