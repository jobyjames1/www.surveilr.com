# Risk Management Process

## Policy Statement
The purpose of the Risk Management Process is to establish a systematic approach to identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Protected Health Information (PHI) as required by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) guidelines. This policy aims to protect patient information and ensure compliance with federal regulations while maintaining an efficient and effective risk management framework.

## Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party service providers who handle, access, or manage PHI within the organization. It encompasses all organizational processes and technologies that store, transmit, or process PHI, ensuring a consistent and comprehensive approach to risk management across the organization.

## Responsibilities
- **Risk Management Team**: Responsible for conducting risk assessments, implementing mitigation strategies, and ensuring ongoing compliance with HIPAA and NIST guidelines.
- **IT Department**: Tasked with the automated collection of evidence, monitoring systems for vulnerabilities, and validating the effectiveness of security controls.
- **Compliance Officer**: Oversees the risk management process, ensuring adherence to regulatory requirements and the integrity of documentation.
- **Management**: Required to review and sign off on risk assessment reports quarterly, ensuring accountability and oversight in the risk management process.

## Evidence Collection Methods
- **Machine Attestability Methods**:
  - Utilize **OSquery** to collect evidence of system configurations and vulnerabilities. OSquery allows for querying system data as if it were a database, enabling automated collection of configuration states and identifying potential risks.
  - Implement **API integrations** with cloud service providers (CSPs) to validate the implementation of security controls. This automation allows for real-time monitoring and documentation of risk management practices across cloud services.
  - Automate the logging processes to ensure that logs related to risk assessments are ingested into **Surveilr** for compliance validation. This includes capturing events associated with risk identification, assessment, and mitigation.

## Verification Criteria
- The organization will verify the completion of the risk management process in accordance with NIST guidelines by:
  - Conducting automated checks through integrated systems that confirm the documentation of risk assessments and mitigation strategies.
  - Ensuring that manual processes are documented effectively, including a thorough audit trail of decisions made and actions taken during the risk management process.
  
## Exceptions
Exceptions to this policy may be granted under specific circumstances, such as:
- Situations where immediate risk mitigation is not feasible due to resource constraints or technical limitations.
- Temporary deviations from standard procedures during system upgrades or migrations.

Management must formally document any exceptions, including:
- The rationale for the exception.
- The duration of the exception.
- A plan for remediation or re-assessment.

### Human Attestation Requirements
- A designated manager must sign off on risk assessment reports quarterly. These signed documents must be uploaded to Surveilr, including metadata such as:
  - Reviewer name
  - Date of review
  - Outcome of the assessment
- Any other necessary human interactions—such as meetings or discussions related to risk management—must be recorded in Surveilr, including timestamps and participant lists.
