# HIPAA Compliance Policy Document  
**Control Code**: 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(B)  
**Control Question**: Has the risk management process been completed using IAW NIST Guidelines? (R)  
**Internal ID**: FII-SCF-RSK-0004  

## 1. Introduction  
This policy outlines the requirements for conducting a risk management process in compliance with HIPAA regulations and NIST guidelines. It ensures that all risks to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of protected health information (PHI) are identified, assessed, and mitigated through systematic and documented processes.

## 2. Policy Statement  
It is the policy of [Organization Name] to implement a comprehensive risk management process that adheres to NIST guidelines. This process must be completed regularly to ensure compliance with HIPAA standards and protect PHI from potential threats.

## 3. Scope  
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party service providers who have access to PHI within [Organization Name]. It encompasses all systems, processes, and data handling practices that involve the management of PHI.

## 4. Responsibilities  
- **Chief Compliance Officer (CCO)**: Oversee the development and implementation of the risk management process.  
- **Risk Management Team**: Conduct risk assessments and maintain documentation.  
- **IT Department**: Support the automation of evidence collection and ensure all systems are compliant.  
- **Compliance Officer**: Review and sign off on risk assessment reports.  

## 5. Evidence Collection Methods  

### Explanation  
To verify that the risk management process has been completed in accordance with NIST guidelines, evidence must be collected to demonstrate that risk assessments are conducted and documented at required intervals.

### Machine Attestation  
- **OSquery Data**: The IT Department shall automate the collection of risk management evidence by ingesting OSquery data into Surveilr to verify that all production servers have the necessary security configurations and controls in place.  
- **API Integrations**: Integrate with cloud service providers to automatically collect logs and configuration data that reflect adherence to risk management protocols.

### Human Attestation (if unavoidable)  
- The Compliance Officer must sign the quarterly risk assessment report, verifying that the risk management process has been completed in accordance with NIST guidelines. This signed report must be uploaded to Surveilr, including metadata such as the review date and outcome.  

## 6. Verification Criteria  
Verification of compliance with this policy will be conducted through regular audits of the Surveilr system to ensure that machine attestation evidence is complete and that human attestations are documented correctly. The Risk Management Team will evaluate the effectiveness of the risk management process and report findings to the CCO.

## 7. Exceptions  
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the Chief Compliance Officer. Exceptions may be granted in instances where machine attestation is not feasible, and a clear justification must be provided.
