You're an **official auditor**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

  * **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
  * **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
      * **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
      * **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
      * **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
  * **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
      * **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
      * **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
      * **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
  * **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

  * **Audit Standard/Framework:** [HIPAA]
** Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "To ensure that access to Electronic Protected Health Information (EPHI) is restricted to authorized personnel only."
Control Code: 164.308(a)(4)(i)
Control Question: Information access management: Implement policies and procedures for authorizing access to EPHI that are consistent with the applicable requirements of subpart E of this part.
Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII): FII-SCF-IAC-0001
  * **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
    "This policy establishes guidelines for authorizing access to Electronic Protected Health Information (EPHI) in compliance with the requirements of 164.308(a)(4)(i) and ensures that access is granted only to authorized individuals while safeguarding sensitive health information. Access requests must be validated against defined criteria and documented in accordance with this policy to ensure compliance with regulatory standards."
  * **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "1. Daily OSquery results showing access logs for all users. 2. API integration results confirming that access requests are processed within 48 hours. 3. Signed quarterly access review report uploaded to Surveilr for Q2 2025."

**Requirements for Your Audit Report (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: HIPAA - 164.308(a)(4)(i)

**Overall Audit Result: [PASS/FAIL]**
**Date of Audit:** [Current Date, e.g., 2025-07-28]
**Auditor Role:** [Your designated auditor role, e.g., HIPAA Auditor]
**Control Code:** 164.308(a)(4)(i)
**Control Question:** Information access management: Implement policies and procedures for authorizing access to EPHI that are consistent with the applicable requirements of subpart E of this part.
**Internal ID (FII):** FII-SCF-IAC-0001
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** To ensure that access to Electronic Protected Health Information (EPHI) is restricted to authorized personnel only.

## 1. Executive Summary

[Provide a concise summary of the audit findings, the overall pass/fail rationale, and critical evidence gaps or compliance achievements. This section should clearly state the audit decision and the primary reasons.]

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

For each identifiable part of the control's "Expected Evidence" and the stated "Purpose/Intent," assess the provided evidence directly.

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Access requests must be processed within 48 hours.
    * **Provided Evidence:** API integration results confirming that access requests are processed within 48 hours.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** API calls to validate access control processes.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM access_requests WHERE processed_time <= '48 hours';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The evidence provided clearly shows that all access requests were processed within the stipulated 48-hour timeframe, meeting the control requirement.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Daily review of access logs for unauthorized access attempts.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Daily OSquery results showing access logs for all users.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** OSquery for endpoint data collection.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM access_logs WHERE unauthorized_access_attempt = TRUE;
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The OSquery results confirm that access logs are reviewed daily, and no unauthorized access attempts were recorded.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Signed quarterly access review report.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Signed quarterly access review report uploaded to Surveilr for Q2 2025.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Document storage of human attestation.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** Evidence of signed document stored in Surveilr.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The signed report confirms that a quarterly review was conducted and documented, fulfilling the evidence requirement.

### 2.2 Human Attestation Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** The IT manager must sign off on the quarterly access review report.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Signed quarterly access review report uploaded to Surveilr.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** IT manager's signature indicating completion of the review.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** Storing the signed report in Surveilr with metadata.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The provided evidence clearly indicates that the IT manager signed off on the report, meeting the control requirement.
