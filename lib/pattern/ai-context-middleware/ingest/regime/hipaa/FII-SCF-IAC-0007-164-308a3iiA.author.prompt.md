You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: 164.308(a)(3)(ii)(A) (FII: FII-SCF-IAC-0007, FII-SCF-IAC-0007.1). 

The policy should be structured as follows:

1. **Introduction**: Clearly state the purpose of the policy regarding the authorization and supervision of employees who work with ePHI or in locations where it might be accessed.

2. **Policy Sections**: Use H2 headings (##) for each major requirement and ensure each section includes:
   - An explanation of the control requirement.
   - Suggested machine attestation methods, such as:
     - "Utilize OSquery to collect and validate access logs of employees with access to ePHI."
     - "Integrate with HR systems to automate verification of employee roles and access permissions."
   - Suggested human attestation methods where unavoidable, such as:
     - "The HR manager must sign off on the quarterly review of employee access logs."

3. **Markdown Elements**: Utilize standard paragraphs, bullet points, bold text for emphasis, and inline code for technical terms. Follow the citation link format for external references: [Link Text](URL).

4. **Attestation Guidance**: 
   - For Machine Attestation: Describe practical methods, e.g., "Verify access to ePHI is limited to authorized personnel by reviewing logs ingested into Surveilr."
   - For Human Attestation: Provide detailed steps, e.g., "The Compliance Officer must sign a quarterly report certifying that all access controls are reviewed."

5. **Format**: Ensure clear sections including Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, and References.

6. **Operational Detail and Specificity (MANDATORY SMART)**: Replace general statements with Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART) instructions. For example, include:
   - A bulleted list of operational steps for access management (e.g., review access logs, update permissions, conduct training).
   - A specific time-bound metric (KPI/SLA) such as "All access permissions to be reviewed at least quarterly."

7. **Comprehensive Scope Definition (MANDATORY)**: Define the policy's scope to encompass all relevant entities and environments, including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems.

8. **Prioritize Machine Attestation**: Provide concrete examples of automated evidence collection for each requirement.

9. **Explicit Human Attestation (When Needed)**: Clearly define the action, artifact, and ingestion method into Surveilr.

10. **Granular Roles and Cross-Referencing (MANDATORY)**: The Responsibilities section must define specific duties for each role, linking to related organizational plans (e.g., Incident Response Plan).

11. **Policy Lifecycle Requirements (MANDATORY)**: Include a subsection detailing minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs and mandatory frequency for policy review and update.

12. **Formal Documentation and Audit (MANDATORY)**: Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, and comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions.

13. **Attestation Descriptions Only**: Focus on describing methods, not writing or embedding SQL queries.

14. **Evidence Collection Methods**: Include subheadings per requirement, explaining the requirement, machine attestation approach, and human attestation where unavoidable.

15. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear measurable criteria for compliance validation.

16. **Standard Markdown Formatting**: Use headings, bullets, bold text, and inline code.

17. **References Section**: End with a ### References section. If no external references exist, use the placeholder: ### References followed by None.

Ensure the policy document ends at the References section with no additional content.
