description: "Security Management Process The Security Management Process involves the establishment and enforcement of comprehensive policies and procedures designed to prevent, detect, contain, and correct any security violations that may compromise sensitive information. This process includes regular assessments and monitoring to identify potential risks and ensure compliance with relevant regulations, ultimately safeguarding the integrity and confidentiality of protected health information (PHI). Organizations must continually evaluate and update their security measures to adapt to evolving threats and maintain compliance with HIPAA requirements."

You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable HIPAA compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for the following control:

**Control Code**: 164.308(a)(1)(i)  
**Control Question**: Security management process: Implement policies and procedures to prevent, detect, contain, and correct security violations. (R)  
**Internal ID**: FII-SCF-GOV-0001, FII-SCF-GOV-0002  

### Policy Document Structure:
- **Introduction** – concise purpose  
- **Policy Statement** – high-level declaration  
- **Scope** – what/who it applies to  
- **Responsibilities** – clear roles/duties  
- **Evidence Collection Methods** – with subheadings per requirement:  
  - **Explanation**  
  - **Machine Attestation**  
  - **Human Attestation (if unavoidable)**  
- **Verification Criteria**  
- **Exceptions**  
- **References**

### Attestation Guidance:
- **Machine Attestation**: e.g., “Verify security controls are in place by ingesting configuration data into Surveilr.”  
- **Human Attestation**: e.g., “Compliance Officer must sign the security management policy review and upload to Surveilr with metadata.”  

**Surveilr’s Core Function**: Automates collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence.  
**Machine Attestation**: Evidence that can be automatically validated. Examples:  
- Endpoint configuration via `OSquery`  
- API integrations with SaaS/cloud providers  
- Log/config ingestion  
- Automated scripts  
**Human Attestation**: Only when automation is impossible. Must be specific and verifiable. Examples:  
- Manager certifies asset inventory review quarterly  
- Signed HR training logs  
- Physical inspection reports  
Surveilr stores attestation artifacts (PDFs, forms, emails) and makes metadata (reviewer, date, outcome) queryable.
