You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: 164.308(a)(1)(i) (FII: FII-SCF-GOV-0001, FII-SCF-GOV-0002). 

The policy must follow this structure:

1. **Introduction**: Provide a concise purpose of the policy.
2. **Policy Statement**: State the overall intent and requirements.
3. **Scope**: Explicitly define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments, such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.
4. **Responsibilities**: Define specific, task-level duties for each role mentioned, using action verbs and frequency (e.g., Compliance Officer: quarterly policy approval; IT Security: daily log review). Explicitly link or reference related organizational plans for escalation and recovery.
5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - Explanation of the requirement
   - Machine Attestation approach: Describe practical, automatable methods for collecting evidence (e.g., "Use OSquery to collect endpoint configuration daily").
   - Human Attestation (if unavoidable): Specify the exact action, artifact, and ingestion method into Surveilr (e.g., "Manager signs quarterly inventory validation report").
6. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation.
7. **Exceptions**: Outline how exceptions will be documented, including justification, duration, and approval.
8. **Policy Lifecycle Requirements**: Detail minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs and the mandatory frequency for policy review and update.
9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgement of understanding and compliance, and comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions.
10. **Markdown Formatting**: Use standard paragraphs, bullet points, bold text for emphasis, and inline code for technical terms. Use [Link Text](URL) format for external references.
11. **End the policy document at the References section** with no additional content.
