You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable HIPAA compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for the following control:

**Control Code**: 164.308(a)(1)(i)  
**Control Question**: Security management process: Implement policies and procedures to prevent, detect, contain, and correct security violations.  
**Internal ID**: FII-SCF-GOV-0001, FII-SCF-GOV-0002  

### Policy Document Structure:
1. **Introduction**  
   - Concise purpose of the policy.  

2. **Policy Statement**  
   - High-level declaration regarding the security management process.  

3. **Scope**  
   - Description of what/who the policy applies to.  

4. **Responsibilities**  
   - Clear roles and duties related to the implementation of the security management process.  

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**  
   - **Explanation**  
     - Overview of how evidence will be collected to support policy compliance.  
   - **Machine Attestation**  
     - Examples include:  
       - “Verify security incidents are logged and reviewed by ingesting logs into Surveilr.”  
       - “Automate alerts for unauthorized access attempts through API integrations.”  
   - **Human Attestation (if unavoidable)**  
     - Examples include:  
       - “IT Security Manager must sign off on security policy reviews quarterly.”  

6. **Verification Criteria**  
   - Define how compliance with the policy will be verified.  

7. **Exceptions**  
   - Outline any exceptions to the policy, if applicable.  

8. **References**  
   - Include relevant documents and standards with `### _References_`.  

### Attestation Guidance:
- **Machine Attestation**: e.g., “Verify security configurations are compliant by ingesting configuration data into Surveilr.”  
- **Human Attestation**: e.g., “Compliance Officer must review and sign the security incident response plan annually, then upload to Surveilr with metadata.”  

Surveilr’s Core Function: Automates collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence.  
Machine Attestation: Evidence that can be automatically validated. Examples include endpoint configuration via `OSquery`, API integrations with SaaS/cloud providers, log/config ingestion, and automated scripts.  
Human Attestation: Only when automation is impossible. Must be specific and verifiable. Examples include manager certifying asset inventory review quarterly, signed HR training logs, and physical inspection reports.  
Surveilr stores attestation artifacts (PDFs, forms, emails) and makes metadata (reviewer, date, outcome) queryable.
