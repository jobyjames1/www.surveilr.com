# HIPAA Compliance Policy for Employee Access to EPHI

## Introduction
This policy outlines the procedures for determining the appropriateness of employee access to Electronic Protected Health Information (EPHI) in accordance with HIPAA control code 164.308(a)(3)(ii)(B). The objective is to ensure that access to EPHI is limited to authorized personnel only, thereby safeguarding patient confidentiality and maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements.

## Policy Statement
The organization commits to implementing and maintaining procedures that evaluate and validate employee access to EPHI to ensure it is appropriate and necessary for their job functions.

## Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party users who have potential access to EPHI stored or processed by the organization.

## Responsibilities
- **Compliance Officer**: Oversee the implementation and enforcement of this policy, ensuring regular reviews and updates.
- **IT Department**: Automate access control audits and maintain the integrity of access logs.
- **Managers**: Evaluate employee roles and determine the necessity for access to EPHI during onboarding and role changes.

## Evidence Collection Methods

### Explanation
Procedures must be in place to assess and validate that employee access to EPHI aligns with their job responsibilities. This includes regular audits and reviews of access levels and permissions.

### Machine Attestation
- **Automated Audits**: Access levels to EPHI will be verified through automated audits of access logs ingested into Surveilr. These logs will be periodically reviewed to ensure that only authorized users maintain access.
- **Endpoint Configuration**: Use `OSquery` to monitor and report on endpoint configurations related to access control for EPHI.

### Human Attestation (if unavoidable)
- **Quarterly Reviews**: The Compliance Officer must review and sign the access control procedures quarterly. This signed documentation must be uploaded to Surveilr along with metadata including reviewer name, date, and outcome.
- **Training Logs**: HR must maintain signed training logs of employees regarding EPHI access and handling, which will be submitted to Surveilr as evidence.

## Verification Criteria
Access to EPHI will be considered appropriate if:
- It aligns with the employee's job responsibilities.
- It has been validated through automated audits or human attestation.
- There are documented procedures in place that support the justification for access.

## Exceptions
Exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the Compliance Officer. Any temporary access granted for specific projects must be closely monitored and revoked post-project completion.
