# HIPAA Compliance Policy for Access Determination to EPHI

**Control Code:** 164.308(a)(3)(ii)(B)  
**Internal ID:** FII-SCF-IAC-0007  
**Control Question:** Have you implemented procedures to determine the access of an employee to EPHI is appropriate? (A)  

## Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to establish clear procedures for determining the appropriateness of employee access to Electronic Protected Health Information (EPHI). Ensuring that access is granted based on necessity and role is essential for safeguarding sensitive health information and maintaining compliance with HIPAA regulations.

## Policy Statement
[Organization Name] is committed to implementing comprehensive procedures that effectively determine and validate employee access to EPHI. Access will be granted based on job responsibilities, the principle of least privilege, and ongoing assessments to ensure compliance with HIPAA standards.

## Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors who require access to EPHI in the course of their work. It encompasses all systems, applications, and processes that handle EPHI within [Organization Name].

## Responsibilities
- **Compliance Officer**: Oversee the implementation of access determination procedures and ensure adherence to HIPAA regulations.
- **Department Managers**: Assess and validate the access needs of their employees, ensuring access aligns with job functions.
- **IT Security Team**: Maintain access control systems and facilitate regular reviews of access logs and permissions.
- **HR Department**: Conduct annual certifications of employee access and maintain documentation related to employee roles.

## Evidence Collection Methods

### Explanation
To ensure compliance with access determination procedures, [Organization Name] will utilize a combination of automated systems and manual reviews. This includes regular audits of access logs, role assessments, and user access reviews.

### Machine Attestation
Surveilr will be employed to automate the collection of evidence regarding access procedures. This includes:
- Verifying access logs through API integrations with Surveilr to confirm appropriate employee access.
- Generating automated reports that track changes in access permissions and flag any discrepancies.

### Human Attestation (if unavoidable)
In circumstances where machine attestation is insufficient, human attestation will be required. Examples include:
- HR must certify employee access reviews annually and upload documentation to Surveilr with metadata indicating the review date and responsible party.
- Department managers may need to provide written confirmation of access appropriateness during quarterly reviews.

## Verification Criteria
To verify the effectiveness of access procedures, [Organization Name] will utilize the following criteria:
- Regular audits of access logs showing alignment with employee roles and responsibilities.
- Documentation of role-based access reviews and adjustments made to access rights.
- Feedback from department heads and employees regarding the adequacy of access controls.

## Exceptions
Exceptions to this policy may be made under specific circumstances, such as:
- Temporary access granted for emergency situations, which will be documented and reviewed post-event.
