This policy applies to:
- All employees who access ePHI.
- Cloud-hosted systems that store or process ePHI.
- Software as a Service (SaaS) applications that handle ePHI.
- Third-party vendor systems that may access, maintain, or transmit ePHI.
- All communication channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

## Responsibilities
- **IT Security Team**: 
  - Review access logs for ePHI daily.
  - Implement machine attestation methods for monitoring.
  
- **Compliance Officer**: 
  - Certify quarterly access reviews of employee access to ePHI.

## Exceptions
Exceptions to this policy may be granted under the following circumstances:
- Temporary access for new employees or contractors pending formal review.
- Emergency access to ePHI for critical incidents, which must be documented and reviewed post-event.

## Policy Lifecycle Requirements
- Minimum data retention period for access logs is 6 years from the date of creation.
- The policy must be reviewed and updated at least annually or as required due to changes in technology or law.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
