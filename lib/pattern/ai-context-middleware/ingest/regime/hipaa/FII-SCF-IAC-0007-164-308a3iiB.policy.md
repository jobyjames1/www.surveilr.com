# Appropriate Access Determination Policy

## Policy Statement

The purpose of this policy is to establish guidelines for determining appropriate access to Electronic Protected Health Information (EPHI) by employees of [Organization Name]. This policy ensures that access to EPHI is granted based on job responsibilities, thereby supporting compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of EPHI.

## Scope

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors of [Organization Name] who have access to EPHI. This includes any personnel who manage, store, or utilize EPHI in the course of their duties.

## Responsibilities

- **Privacy Officer**: Responsible for overseeing the implementation of this policy and ensuring compliance with HIPAA regulations.
- **IT Security Team**: Responsible for the technical implementation and maintenance of access controls and monitoring systems.
- **HR Department**: Responsible for maintaining accurate records of employee roles and access permissions.
- **Department Managers**: Responsible for identifying the specific access needs of their team members and communicating these to the IT Security Team.

## Evidence Collection Methods

To ensure appropriate access to EPHI, the following evidence collection methods will be prioritized:

### Automated Evidence Collection

- **OSquery**: Utilize OSquery to collect and validate endpoint configurations, ensuring that access levels to EPHI are appropriate based on user roles.
  
- **API Integrations**: Implement API integrations with cloud service providers to automatically verify user access controls related to EPHI. This will ensure real-time monitoring and compliance with access policies.

- **System Logs Ingestion**: Ingest system logs directly into **Surveilr** to confirm adherence to policy regarding access to EPHI. This includes tracking user access patterns and any unauthorized attempts to access EPHI.

### Human Attestation Methods

Human attestation methods will be utilized only when automation is impractical:

- **Quarterly Certification by HR**: The HR manager must certify quarterly that access permissions for employees are reviewed and documented. This certification should include details of any changes made to access permissions.

- **Access Review Report**: A signed access review report must be uploaded to **Surveilr**, including metadata such as the reviewer's name, date of review, and any findings or actions taken.

## Verification Criteria

To verify that access determination procedures are effective, the following criteria will be assessed:

- **Automated Evidence**: Regular audits of automated evidence collection methods (OSquery outputs, API integration logs, and Surveilr logs) will be conducted to ensure that access levels are in accordance with established policies.

- **Human Attestation Effectiveness**: The quarterly certification and access review report should be submitted on time, with evidence of completed reviews stored in **Surveilr**. Any discrepancies or anomalies must be documented and addressed promptly.

## Exceptions

Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the Privacy Officer. Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis, especially in situations where access is necessary for legal or regulatory compliance, or during emergency response scenarios.
