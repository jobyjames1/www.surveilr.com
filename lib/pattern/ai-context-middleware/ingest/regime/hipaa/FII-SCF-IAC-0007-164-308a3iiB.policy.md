# HIPAA Compliance Policy for Employee Access to EPHI

## **Introduction**
The purpose of this policy is to ensure that appropriate procedures are in place for determining employee access to Electronic Protected Health Information (EPHI) in compliance with HIPAA control code 164.308(a)(3)(ii)(B). This policy outlines the responsibilities, evidence collection methods, and verification criteria necessary to uphold the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of EPHI.

## **Policy Statement**
Our organization is committed to ensuring that access to EPHI is restricted to authorized personnel only. We will implement and maintain effective procedures to regularly assess and verify that employee access rights to EPHI are appropriate based on their job responsibilities.

## **Scope**
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party service providers who have access to EPHI within the organization. It encompasses all systems, applications, and environments where EPHI is stored, processed, or transmitted.

## **Responsibilities**
- **Compliance Officer**: Oversees the implementation of this policy and ensures compliance with HIPAA regulations.
- **IT Department**: Responsible for the technical implementation of access controls and the collection of machine attestations.
- **Human Resources (HR)**: Manages employee access requests and ensures proper documentation is maintained for human attestations.
- **Department Managers**: Conduct periodic reviews of employee access and ensure that access rights align with job functions.

## **Evidence Collection Methods**

### **Explanation**
To ensure employee access to EPHI is appropriate, procedures will be implemented to regularly review and validate access rights. This includes both automated and manual methods of attestation.

### **Machine Attestation**
- **Access Log Ingestion**: Verify that user access levels are appropriate by ingesting access log data into Surveilr. This includes monitoring and analyzing logs to ensure that access rights align with the employee's current role and responsibilities.
- **Endpoint Configuration**: Utilize `OSquery` to check endpoint configurations for compliance with access control policies.
- **Automated Scripts**: Deploy scripts that regularly audit user permissions against a defined baseline of appropriate access levels.

### **Human Attestation (if unavoidable)**
- **Quarterly Review Certification**: Department managers will certify quarterly that access rights have been reviewed and are appropriate. This certification will be documented, and the signed evidence will be uploaded to Surveilr with relevant metadata (reviewer, date, outcome).
- **Access Request Documentation**: HR will maintain signed access request forms for each employee, which must be uploaded to Surveilr for documentation purposes. This includes any changes in access permissions.

## **Verification Criteria**
The following criteria will be used to validate compliance with this policy:
- Evidence of regular access reviews conducted by department managers.
- Records of machine-generated attestations from Surveilr regarding user access.
- Documentation of any human attestations, including signed forms and quarterly certification records.
- Verification that access levels are aligned with job functions and responsibilities within the organization.

## **Exceptions**
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the Compliance Officer. Exceptions may be granted in instances where business needs require temporary access changes that do not align with established access control procedures.
