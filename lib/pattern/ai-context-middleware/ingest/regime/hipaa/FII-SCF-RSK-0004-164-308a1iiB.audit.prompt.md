You're an **official auditor (e.g., auditor)**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

  * **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
  * **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
      * **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
      * **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
      * **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
  * **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
      * **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
      * **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
      * **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
  * **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

  * **Audit Standard/Framework:** [NIST Guidelines]
  * **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "To ensure that the risk management process is completed in accordance with NIST guidelines, thus enhancing the organization's ability to manage and mitigate risks effectively."
Control Code: 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(B),
Control Question: Has the risk management process been completed using IAW NIST Guidelines? (R)
Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII): FII-SCF-RSK-0004
  * **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
    "The organization is required to complete a risk management process that aligns with NIST guidelines. This includes identifying, assessing, and responding to risks to the organization’s assets, individuals, and operations. Evidence of risk assessments must be collected and verified automatically, and when automated methods cannot be employed, documentation must be completed and signed by relevant personnel."
  * **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "Risk assessment reports have been ingested into the Surveilr platform, confirming that quarterly risk assessments were conducted as per policy. Logs indicate effective automated data collection. However, there is a lack of managerial sign-off on the risk management documentation for the last quarter."

**Requirements for Your Audit Report (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: NIST Guidelines - 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(B)

**Overall Audit Result: [FAIL]**
**Date of Audit:** [2023-10-02]
**Auditor Role:** [Risk Management Auditor]
**Control Code:** [164.308(a)(1)(ii)(B)]
**Control Question:** [Has the risk management process been completed using IAW NIST Guidelines? (R)]
**Internal ID (FII):** [FII-SCF-RSK-0004]
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** [To ensure that the risk management process is completed in accordance with NIST guidelines, thus enhancing the organization's ability to manage and mitigate risks effectively.]

## 1. Executive Summary

The audit findings indicate that while risk assessment reports have been successfully ingested into the Surveilr platform, thereby confirming the conduct of quarterly assessments, the absence of managerial sign-off on the documentation for the last quarter represents a critical compliance gap. This lack of human attestation leads to a "FAIL" determination.

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** The requirement to conduct quarterly risk assessments and collect evidence automatically.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Risk assessment reports ingested into Surveilr confirm quarterly assessments were conducted.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Automated ingestion of risk assessment data via API calls into the RSSD.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM risk_assessments WHERE assessment_date >= LAST_QUARTER;
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The evidence shows that risk assessments were conducted and documented in line with the control requirements.

### 2.2 Human Attestation Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Managerial sign-off on risk management documentation to ensure compliance.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Lack of managerial sign-off on the last quarter's risk management documentation.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** Managers must review and approve all risk assessments.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** The act of human attestation was not recorded as required.
    * **Compliance Status:** NON-COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The absence of managerial sign-off signifies non-compliance with the requirement for human attestation, which is critical for validating the risk management process.

## 3. Overall Alignment with Control's Intent & Spirit

* **Assessment:** The provided evidence demonstrates compliance with the procedural aspects of the control but fails to meet the intent due to the lack of necessary human oversight.
* **Justification:** While the organization has effectively automated the collection of risk assessment data, the absence of managerial sign-off compromises the trust and accountability integral to the risk management process.
* **Critical Gaps in Spirit (if applicable):** The lack of a managerial review for the last quarter undermines the organizational commitment to risk management, which is essential for effective compliance.

## 4. Audit Conclusion and Final Justification

* **Final Decision:** FAIL
* **Comprehensive Rationale:** The audit decision is based on the critical non-compliance identified due to the absence of managerial sign-off on risk management documentation. The automated evidence is compelling but insufficient without the requisite human attestation.

## 5. Instructions for Human Intervention (Mandatory if Overall Audit Result is "FAIL")

**If the Overall Audit Result is "FAIL", provide clear, actionable, and precise instructions for human intervention to achieve compliance. This section is an auditor's directive.**

* **Specific Missing Evidence Required:**
    * Obtain signed risk management documentation for the last quarter (FII-SCF-RSK-0004) to verify managerial approval.
* **Specific Non-Compliant Evidence Required Correction:**
    * Provide evidence of managerial review and sign-off for the risk management documentation from the last quarter.
* **Required Human Action Steps:**
    * Engage the Compliance Officer to retrieve the required signed documentation.
    * Contact relevant managers to obtain the necessary approvals for the last quarter’s risk assessments.
* **Next Steps for Re-Audit:** Once the signed documentation is obtained, resubmit the evidence for re-evaluation.
