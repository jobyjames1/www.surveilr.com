# **Policy for Terminating Access to Electronic Protected Health Information (EPHI)**

### **Introduction**  
The purpose of this policy is to establish procedures for the prompt and secure termination of access to Electronic Protected Health Information (EPHI) when an employee leaves the organization or as required by regulatory obligations. This policy is designed to ensure compliance with HIPAA regulations and to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of EPHI.

### **Policy Statement**  
The organization is committed to ensuring that access to EPHI is terminated immediately upon an employee’s departure or as dictated by specific circumstances outlined in paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(B) of HIPAA. This policy mandates the implementation of systematic procedures to revoke access rights, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive health information.

### **Scope**  
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors who have access to EPHI within the organization. It encompasses all systems and applications that store, process, or transmit EPHI.

### **Responsibilities**  
- **Human Resources (HR)**: Responsible for notifying the IT department and Compliance Officer of employee departures and ensuring relevant documentation is prepared.
- **IT Department**: Responsible for executing the termination of access to EPHI and maintaining access control logs.
- **Compliance Officer**: Responsible for overseeing adherence to this policy and the verification of access termination processes.
- **Department Managers**: Responsible for identifying and reporting access needs and changes within their teams.

### **Evidence Collection Methods**  
- **Explanation**  
  To ensure compliance with the termination of access, evidence will be collected through detailed logs and records of access changes.

- **Machine Attestation**  
  Access to EPHI will be verified by querying user access logs via Surveilr to ensure that access permissions for terminated employees have been revoked.

- **Human Attestation (if unavoidable)**  
  HR must certify the termination of access for departing employees. This certification will be documented and uploaded to Surveilr with relevant metadata, including the date of termination and the employee's identification.

### **Verification Criteria**  
Compliance with this policy will be verified through:
- Regular audits of access logs to confirm that access has been revoked for all terminated employees.
- Review of HR records to ensure that all departures are documented and communicated to the IT department.
- Confirmation from the Compliance Officer that all documented terminations of access are complete and accurate.

### **Exceptions**  
Any exceptions to this policy must be requested in writing and approved by the Compliance Officer. Exceptions may be granted for specific circumstances that warrant continued access for a designated period, such as ongoing legal investigations or other regulatory requirements.

- U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, HIPAA Administrative Simplification Regulations, 45 CFR § 164.308(a)(3)(ii)(C)  
- Organization’s Employee Handbook  
- Surveilr Access Management Protocols  

### **Attestation Guidance**  
- **Machine Attestation**: Verify that access permissions for terminated employees are updated in Surveilr by analyzing access logs.
- **Human Attestation**: The Compliance Officer must sign off on access termination for all departing employees and upload the signed document to Surveilr with relevant metadata.

This policy will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary to reflect changes in regulatory requirements or organizational practices. Compliance with this policy is mandatory for all personnel with access to EPHI.
