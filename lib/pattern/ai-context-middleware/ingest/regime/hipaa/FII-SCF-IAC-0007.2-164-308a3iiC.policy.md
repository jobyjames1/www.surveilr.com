# HIPAA Compliance Policy for Terminating Access to EPHI

## Introduction
This policy outlines the procedures implemented to ensure that access to Electronic Protected Health Information (EPHI) is terminated when an employee leaves the organization or as mandated by relevant regulations. This is essential for maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of EPHI in accordance with HIPAA regulations.

## Policy Statement
It is the policy of [Organization Name] to ensure that access to EPHI is promptly terminated for any employee leaving the organization, or as required under specific circumstances outlined in HIPAA regulation 164.308(a)(3)(ii)(B). This is to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive health information.

## Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party users who have been granted access to EPHI within [Organization Name]. It encompasses all systems, applications, and platforms where EPHI is stored or processed.

## Responsibilities
- **Human Resources (HR)**: Responsible for notifying IT of employee terminations and conducting employee exit interviews.
- **IT Department**: Responsible for executing the termination of access to EPHI and maintaining records of access termination.
- **Compliance Officer**: Responsible for overseeing adherence to this policy and ensuring that procedures align with HIPAA requirements.

## Evidence Collection Methods

### Explanation
To ensure compliance with the termination of access to EPHI, [Organization Name] will utilize both automated and manual methods for evidence collection. The focus will be on machine attestation due to its efficiency and reliability, with human attestation reserved for instances where automation is not feasible.

### Machine Attestation
- **OSquery Data Collection**: Access to EPHI will be validated through automated OSquery data ingestion into Surveilr. This will confirm the removal of user permissions and provide real-time evidence that access has been terminated.
- **API Integrations**: Integration with SaaS/cloud providers will allow for automated monitoring and reporting on user access, ensuring that any changes are logged and verifiable.

### Human Attestation (if unavoidable)
- **Employee Termination Checklist**: When automation is not possible, HR will complete an employee termination checklist and sign it to certify that all access to EPHI has been terminated. This checklist will then be uploaded to Surveilr, along with metadata including the reviewer's name, date, and outcome.

## Verification Criteria
Verification of compliance with this policy will be conducted through regular audits of access logs, OSquery data, and human attestation records. The Compliance Officer will ensure that all termination processes are documented and that evidence is readily accessible for review.

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the Compliance Officer. Exceptions may be granted in extraordinary circumstances, provided that they do not compromise the security of EPHI.
