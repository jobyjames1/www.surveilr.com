# Policy for Protecting ePHI from Larger Organizations

## Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to establish and document the requirements for protecting electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI) from unauthorized access or disclosure by larger organizations of which the clearinghouse is a part. This policy ensures compliance with relevant regulations and implements comprehensive safeguards to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI.

## Policy Statement
The clearinghouse must implement robust policies and procedures that specifically address the protection of ePHI from the larger organization. These policies should include effective access controls, data encryption, and monitoring mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access.

## Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and affiliated parties within the clearinghouse and extends to all environments where ePHI is created, received, maintained, or transmitted. This includes:
- On-premises systems
- Cloud-hosted environments
- Software as a Service (SaaS) applications
- Third-party vendor systems

## Responsibilities
- **Compliance Officer**: Oversees policy implementation and compliance monitoring.
- **IT Security Team**: Responsible for configuring and maintaining security controls.
- **Data Custodians**: Ensure proper handling and storage of ePHI.

## Evidence Collection Methods

### Access Control Monitoring
- **Machine Attestation**: Utilize tools like OSquery to regularly collect and analyze access logs for all systems interacting with ePHI, ensuring that only authorized personnel have access.
- **Human Attestation**: Annually, the Compliance Officer will sign a report confirming that access control policies have been reviewed and enforced.

### Data Encryption
- **Machine Attestation**: Implement automated checks to confirm that all data at rest and in transit is encrypted using industry-standard protocols. Use Surveilr to monitor encryption status.
- **Human Attestation**: The IT Security Team must document and submit a quarterly report affirming the encryption status of ePHI systems, signed by the Head of IT Security.

### Incident Response Procedures
- **Machine Attestation**: Configure automated alerts for any unauthorized access attempts to ePHI, documented and analyzed through Surveilr.
- **Human Attestation**: The Incident Response Team must conduct annual drills and submit a signed report of drill outcomes and lessons learned.

## Verification Criteria
- Compliance will be measured through:
  - Monthly reports showing 100% compliance with access control policies.
  - Quarterly encryption status reports indicating no unencrypted ePHI.
  - Annual incident response drill completion with documented improvements.

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be formally documented. Exceptions require the approval of the Compliance Officer and must be reviewed annually.

## Policy Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: All evidence logs must be retained for a minimum of 6 years.
- **Policy Review**: This policy must be reviewed and updated annually or as necessitated by changes in regulations or organizational practices.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge understanding and compliance with this policy. Comprehensive audit logging will be maintained for critical actions related to ePHI access and handling, and formal documentation will be created for any exceptions to the policy.
