# HIPAA Compliance Policy Document  
**Control Code**: 164.308(a)(4)(ii)(A)  
**Internal ID**: FII-SCF-IAC-0001  

## Introduction  
The purpose of this policy is to ensure that [Organization Name], as a clearinghouse that is part of a larger organization, implements appropriate policies and procedures to protect Electronic Protected Health Information (EPHI) from unauthorized access or disclosure by the larger organization. This is critical for maintaining HIPAA compliance and safeguarding patient privacy.

## Policy Statement  
[Organization Name] is committed to protecting EPHI from potential risks posed by its association with a larger organization. This policy outlines the necessary measures and practices that must be adopted to ensure compliance with HIPAA regulations, specifically control code 164.308(a)(4)(ii)(A).

## Scope  
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party service providers of [Organization Name] who have access to EPHI. It encompasses all systems and processes involved in the handling, storage, and transmission of EPHI.

## Responsibilities  
- **Compliance Officer**: Responsible for the overall implementation and oversight of this policy.
- **IT Security Team**: Ensures that technical safeguards are in place to protect EPHI from unauthorized access.
- **All Employees**: Must adhere to the policies and procedures outlined in this document and report any security incidents or breaches.

## Evidence Collection Methods  

### Explanation  
To demonstrate compliance with this policy, [Organization Name] will implement a combination of machine and human attestation methods to gather and validate evidence of EPHI protection.

### Machine Attestation  
- **Endpoint Configuration**: Utilize `OSquery` to verify that all endpoints that store or process EPHI have the required security configurations and agents installed. The data collected will be ingested into Surveilr for automated validation.
- **API Integrations**: Establish secure API connections with SaaS/cloud providers to ensure that EPHI is transmitted securely and that appropriate access controls are enforced.
- **Log Ingestion**: Regularly ingest logs from system activity, access controls, and security events into Surveilr to monitor compliance and identify any unauthorized access attempts.

### Human Attestation (if unavoidable)  
- **Quarterly Risk Assessment**: The Compliance Officer must conduct a quarterly risk assessment of EPHI handling practices, certify the findings, and upload the signed report to Surveilr with appropriate metadata, including the date and outcome of the assessment.
- **Training Acknowledgment**: Employees must complete HIPAA training annually and provide signed acknowledgment forms, which will be stored in Surveilr for verification.

## Verification Criteria  
- Evidence of machine attestation must be retrieved and validated through Surveilr, demonstrating compliance with security configurations and access controls.
- Human attestations must be submitted on time and contain verifiable metadata, ensuring that all required actions have been completed as per policy guidelines.

## Exceptions  
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and authorized by the Compliance Officer. Exceptions will be reviewed annually to determine if they are still warranted.
