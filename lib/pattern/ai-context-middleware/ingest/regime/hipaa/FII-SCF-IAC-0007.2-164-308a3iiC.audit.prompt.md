You're an **official auditor (e.g., HIPAA Auditor)**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

* **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
* **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
    * **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
    * **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
    * **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
* **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
    * **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
    * **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
    * **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
* **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

* **Audit Standard/Framework:** HIPAA
* **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "To establish procedures for terminating access to electronic Protected Health Information (EPHI) in compliance with HIPAA regulation 164.308(a)(3)(ii)(C). This ensures that access rights are revoked promptly and appropriately when an employee leaves the organization or as required by other specified conditions."
  * **Control Code:** 164.308(a)(3)(ii)(C)
  * **Control Question:** "Have you implemented procedures for terminating access to EPHI when an employee leaves your organization or as required by paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(B) of this section? (A)"
  * **Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII):** FII-SCF-IAC-0007.2
* **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
  "The purpose of this policy is to establish procedures for terminating access to electronic Protected Health Information (EPHI) in compliance with HIPAA regulation 164.308(a)(3)(ii)(C). This ensures that access rights are revoked promptly and appropriately when an employee leaves the organization or as required by other specified conditions. The policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party affiliates who have access to EPHI."
* **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "Evidence includes logs of access terminations ingested into Surveilr from identity management systems, OSquery results for monitoring unauthorized access attempts post-termination, and access termination checklists signed and stored in Surveilr."

**Requirements for Your Audit Report (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: HIPAA - 164.308(a)(3)(ii)(C)

**Overall Audit Result: [PASS/FAIL]**
**Date of Audit:** [Current Date, e.g., 2025-07-28]
**Auditor Role:** HIPAA Auditor
**Control Code:** 164.308(a)(3)(ii)(C)
**Control Question:** "Have you implemented procedures for terminating access to EPHI when an employee leaves your organization or as required by paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(B) of this section? (A)"
**Internal ID (FII):** FII-SCF-IAC-0007.2
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "To establish procedures for terminating access to electronic Protected Health Information (EPHI) in compliance with HIPAA regulation 164.308(a)(3)(ii)(C). This ensures that access rights are revoked promptly and appropriately when an employee leaves the organization or as required by other specified conditions."

## 1. Executive Summary

[Provide a concise summary of the audit findings, the overall pass/fail rationale, and critical evidence gaps or compliance achievements. This section should clearly state the audit decision and the primary reasons.]

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

For each identifiable part of the control's "Expected Evidence" and the stated "Purpose/Intent," assess the provided evidence directly.

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Timely revocation of access to EPHI through identity management systems.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Logs of access terminations ingested into Surveilr.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Automated data ingestion from identity management systems.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM access_logs WHERE termination_date = CURRENT_DATE;
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The logs confirm that access was revoked in a timely manner according to the policy.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Monitoring unauthorized access attempts post-termination.
    * **Provided Evidence:** OSquery results indicating no unauthorized access attempts recorded after terminations.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Endpoint configuration monitoring using OSquery.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM endpoint_logs WHERE access_attempt = 'unauthorized' AND date > termination_date;
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** No unauthorized access attempts were found in the logs, demonstrating effective monitoring.

### 2.2 Human Attestation Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Completion of access termination checklist for departing employees.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Signed access termination checklist uploaded to Surveilr.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** HR must complete and sign the termination checklist.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** Checklist is stored in Surveilr with metadata.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The checklist is complete and signed, confirming adherence to the termination policy.

## 3. Overall Alignment with Control's Intent Spirit

* **Assessment:** The evidence provided demonstrates that the organization is effectively terminating access to EPHI as required.
