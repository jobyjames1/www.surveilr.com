description: "Access Authorization Policies This control requires the establishment of robust policies and procedures to regulate access to Electronic Protected Health Information (EPHI). These policies must align with the requirements outlined in subpart E of HIPAA, ensuring that only authorized individuals have access to sensitive health information, thereby maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of EPHI. Regular reviews and updates to these policies are essential to adapt to any changes in regulations or organizational needs."

You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable HIPAA compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for the following control:

**Control Code**: 164.308(a)(4)(i)  
**Control Question**: Information access management: Implement policies and procedures for authorizing access to EPHI that are consistent with the applicable requirements of subpart E of this part. (R)  
**Internal ID**: FII-SCF-IAC-0001  

### Policy Document Structure
- **Introduction** – concise purpose  
- **Policy Statement** – high-level declaration  
- **Scope** – what/who it applies to  
- **Responsibilities** – clear roles/duties  
- **Evidence Collection Methods** – with subheadings per requirement:  
  - Explanation  
  - Machine Attestation  
  - Human Attestation (if unavoidable)  
- **Verification Criteria**  
- **Exceptions**  
- **References**

### Foundational Knowledge
- **Surveilr’s Core Function**: Automates collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence.  
- **Machine Attestation**: Evidence that can be automatically validated. Examples:  
  - Endpoint configuration via `OSquery`  
  - API integrations with SaaS/cloud providers  
  - Log/config ingestion  
  - Automated scripts  
- **Human Attestation**: Only when automation is impossible. Must be specific and verifiable. Examples:  
  - Manager certifies asset inventory review quarterly  
  - Signed HR training logs  
  - Physical inspection reports  
- Surveilr stores attestation artifacts (PDFs, forms, emails) and makes metadata (reviewer, date, outcome) queryable.  

### Attestation Guidance
- **Machine Attestation**: e.g., “Verify access controls on systems containing EPHI by ingesting OSquery data into Surveilr.”  
- **Human Attestation**: e.g., “Compliance Officer must approve access authorization requests and upload the signed document to Surveilr with metadata.”
