You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: 164.308(a)(4)(i) (FII: FII-SCF-IAC-0001). 

**Policy Document Structure:**
- **Introduction:** Provide a concise purpose of the policy regarding information access management for EPHI.
  
- **Policy Sections:**
  - ## Policy Statement: Clearly state the policy regarding access authorization to EPHI.
  - ## Scope: Define the scope to include cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit EPHI.
  - ## Responsibilities: Outline specific task-level duties for roles involved in access management, including frequency (e.g., Compliance Officer: quarterly policy approval; IT Security: daily access log review).
  - ## Evidence Collection Methods: 
    - ### Machine Attestation: Describe practical methods for automated evidence collection, such as using API integrations with cloud providers to validate access controls or ingesting system logs to confirm policy adherence.
    - ### Human Attestation: Specify exact actions, artifacts, and ingestion methods into Surveilr for unavoidable human attestations.
  - ## Verification Criteria: Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation.
  - ## Exceptions: Detail the process for documenting exceptions, including justification and approval.
  
- **Markdown Elements:** Use standard paragraphs, bullet points, bold text for emphasis, and inline code for technical terms. Format external references using [Link Text](URL).

- **Attestation Guidance:**
  - **For Machine Attestation:** Describe automated evidence collection methods (e.g., "Use OSquery to collect user access logs daily").
  - **For Human Attestation:** Describe the precise steps (e.g., "The IT manager must sign off on the quarterly access review report. Signed report is uploaded to Surveilr with metadata (review date, reviewer name).").

- **Operational Detail and Specificity:** Replace general statements with Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART) instructions. Include a bulleted list of 3-5 operational steps for processes, with specific time-bound metrics (e.g., "Contain unauthorized access attempts within 48 hours").

- **Policy Lifecycle Requirements:** Include minimum data retention periods (e.g., 'retain evidence for 6 years') and mandatory frequency for policy review and update (e.g., 'reviewed at least annually').

- **Formal Documentation and Audit:** Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.
