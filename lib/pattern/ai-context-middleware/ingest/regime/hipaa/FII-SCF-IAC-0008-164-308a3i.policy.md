# Workforce Security Policy for Electronic Protected Health Information (EPHI)

## Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to establish a framework for ensuring that all members of the workforce have appropriate access to electronic protected health information (EPHI) in compliance with HIPAA regulations, specifically control code 164.308(a)(3)(i). This policy outlines the necessary procedures to prevent unauthorized access to EPHI.

## Policy Statement
It is the policy of [Organization Name] to implement robust policies and procedures that ensure that all workforce members have the appropriate access to EPHI as mandated under HIPAA, while preventing access by those who do not have authorization.

## Scope
This policy applies to all members of the workforce, including employees, contractors, and third-party service providers who have potential access to EPHI within [Organization Name].

## Responsibilities
- **Compliance Officer**: Oversees the implementation of this policy and ensures adherence to HIPAA regulations.
- **Human Resources (HR)**: Responsible for maintaining accurate workforce access records and conducting quarterly access reviews.
- **IT Department**: Implements and maintains technology solutions for access control and monitoring.
- **Employees**: Must adhere to access policies and report any suspicious activity concerning EPHI access.

## Evidence Collection Methods

### Explanation
To ensure compliance with workforce security measures, [Organization Name] will utilize both machine and human attestation to validate access controls for EPHI.

### Machine Attestation
- **Access Logs**: Verify user access to EPHI through regular audits of access logs stored in Surveilr.
- **Configuration Audits**: Utilize `OSquery` to assess endpoint configurations and access permissions related to EPHI.

### Human Attestation (if unavoidable)
- **Quarterly Access Review**: HR must certify workforce access reviews quarterly. The certification must be documented and uploaded to Surveilr, including metadata such as reviewer name, date, and outcome.
- **Training Logs**: Maintain signed HR training logs evidencing that all workforce members have received appropriate training regarding access to EPHI.

## Verification Criteria
- Access logs and configuration audits must show that only authorized personnel have access to EPHI.
- Quarterly review certifications and training logs must be current and verifiable through Surveilr.

## Exceptions
Exceptions to this policy may only be granted by the Compliance Officer and must be documented with a justification. Any exceptions must not compromise the security of EPHI.
