# Workforce Security Policy for Electronic Protected Health Information (EPHI)

## **Introduction**
This policy aims to ensure that all members of the workforce have appropriate access to electronic protected health information (EPHI) in compliance with HIPAA regulations. It outlines the necessary procedures and controls to prevent unauthorized access to EPHI.

## **Policy Statement**
The organization is committed to implementing and maintaining effective policies and procedures that ensure appropriate access to EPHI for authorized workforce members while preventing unauthorized access. 

## **Scope**
This policy applies to all workforce members who have access to EPHI, including employees, contractors, and third-party vendors.

## **Responsibilities**
- **Compliance Officer**: Oversees the implementation and enforcement of this policy, ensuring compliance with HIPAA regulations.
- **IT Department**: Responsible for configuring systems and implementing technical controls to restrict access to EPHI.
- **Human Resources**: Ensures that workforce members are properly trained and that access rights are aligned with job responsibilities.

## **Evidence Collection Methods**

### **1. Access Control Implementation**
#### **Explanation**
Access controls must be implemented to ensure that only authorized personnel can access EPHI based on their job functions.

#### **Machine Attestation**
- Validate that access control mechanisms are in place by ingesting access logs into Surveilr.
- Utilize OSquery to verify that user roles and permissions are configured according to policy.

#### **Human Attestation**
- In cases where automation is not feasible, the Compliance Officer must review and certify user access rights quarterly, uploading the signed certification to Surveilr with metadata.

### **2. Training and Awareness**
#### **Explanation**
All workforce members must undergo training on HIPAA regulations and the handling of EPHI to ensure they understand their responsibilities regarding access.

#### **Machine Attestation**
- Track training completion through integration with the Learning Management System (LMS) to automatically log training records in Surveilr.

#### **Human Attestation**
- If LMS integration is unavailable, HR must maintain signed training logs that verify participation and upload them to Surveilr.

### **3. Monitoring and Auditing**
#### **Explanation**
Regular monitoring and auditing of access to EPHI are necessary to identify any unauthorized access attempts or anomalies.

#### **Machine Attestation**
- Automate the collection of audit logs from all systems that store or process EPHI, and ingest them into Surveilr for analysis.

#### **Human Attestation**
- If automated auditing is not possible, the Compliance Officer must conduct biannual audits of access logs and document findings, uploading reports to Surveilr.

## **Verification Criteria**
- Successful ingestion of access control configurations and audit logs into Surveilr.
- Completion of required training by all workforce members.
- Quarterly and biannual reviews certified by the Compliance Officer.

## **Exceptions**
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved in writing by the Compliance Officer. Exceptions should be justified based on business needs and should not compromise the security of EPHI.
