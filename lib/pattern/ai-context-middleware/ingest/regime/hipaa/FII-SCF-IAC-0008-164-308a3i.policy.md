# Workforce Security Policy 

## Policy Statement
The purpose of this policy is to establish guidelines and procedures to ensure that all workforce members have appropriate access to electronic protected health information (EPHI) as required by HIPAA regulations under control code 164.308(a)(3)(i). Workforce security is vital to safeguarding EPHI from unauthorized access and potential breaches, thereby protecting the privacy and security of our patients' sensitive information. 

## Scope
This policy applies to all workforce members, including employees, contractors, interns, and volunteers who have access to EPHI. Exceptions to this policy may apply to workforce members who do not require access to EPHI for their job responsibilities or who are granted limited access under specific circumstances, as outlined in the exceptions section below.

## Responsibilities
- **Workforce Members**: Must adhere to this policy, ensuring that their access to EPHI is appropriate based on their job roles and responsibilities. They are also responsible for reporting any potential security breaches or unauthorized access.
- **Management**: Responsible for assessing workforce member roles and determining appropriate access levels to EPHI. Management must also ensure that all workforce members receive training on this policy and its implications.
- **Compliance Officers**: Tasked with overseeing the implementation of this policy, conducting regular audits, and ensuring compliance with HIPAA regulations. They are responsible for documenting compliance efforts and addressing any violations.

## Evidence Collection Methods
- **Automated Attestation with OSquery**: Implement OSquery to regularly collect and verify endpoint configurations and access controls. This automation will facilitate real-time monitoring and reporting of workforce access to EPHI.
  
- **API Integrations**: Establish API integrations with cloud or SaaS providers to automatically validate user access to EPHI. This method ensures that access rights are consistently monitored and updated based on the most current employment status and role requirements.

- **System Log Ingestion into Surveilr**: Ingest system logs into Surveilr to confirm adherence to access control policies. This will allow for continuous monitoring of access patterns and identification of any anomalies.

## Verification Criteria
- Regular audits will be conducted using automated tools to assess compliance with access control policies. These audits will ensure that:
  - Each workforce member's access to EPHI is appropriate.
  - There are no unauthorized access attempts or breaches.
  - Any discrepancies are addressed promptly.

- **Human Attestation**: Managers must complete and sign a quarterly validation report confirming that workforce access to EPHI has been reviewed. This report must be documented and uploaded to Surveilr, capturing the following metadata:
  - Reviewer Name
  - Date of Review
  - Outcome of Review (e.g., compliant, non-compliant)

## Exceptions
Some exceptions to the policy may arise, particularly for roles that do not require access to EPHI. Workforce members seeking exceptions must submit a written request detailing the justification for their access needs. Approval for exceptions will be granted by management and documented accordingly.
