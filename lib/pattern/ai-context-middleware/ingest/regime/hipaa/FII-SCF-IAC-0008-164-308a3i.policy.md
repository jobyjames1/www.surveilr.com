# HIPAA Compliance Policy Document for Control 164.308(a)(3)(i)

## Introduction
This policy outlines the requirements for workforce security in relation to electronic protected health information (EPHI) as mandated by HIPAA. The purpose of this document is to ensure that all workforce members have appropriate access to EPHI and to prevent unauthorized access.

## Policy Statement
Our organization is committed to implementing and maintaining policies and procedures that ensure all members of the workforce have appropriate access to EPHI, in accordance with HIPAA standards. We will take necessary measures to prevent workforce members without appropriate access from obtaining access to EPHI.

## Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors who may access EPHI in the course of their duties. It covers all information systems and physical locations where EPHI is stored, processed, or transmitted.

## Responsibilities
- **Compliance Officer**: 
  - Oversee the implementation of workforce security policies.
  - Ensure regular audits and reviews of access permissions.
  
- **IT Department**: 
  - Implement access controls and monitor access logs.
  - Ensure that endpoint configurations comply with security standards.
  
- **Human Resources (HR)**: 
  - Maintain records of employee access permissions.
  - Conduct training sessions on HIPAA compliance and access control.

- **All Workforce Members**: 
  - Adhere to the established access protocols.
  - Report any unauthorized access or security incidents.

## Evidence Collection Methods

### Explanation
To ensure compliance with this policy, evidence will be collected to verify that appropriate access controls are in place and functioning correctly.

### Machine Attestation
1. **Access Logs**: Ingest access log data into Surveilr to verify that only authorized individuals access EPHI.
2. **Endpoint Configurations**: Utilize `OSquery` to confirm that devices accessing EPHI are configured according to established security policies.
3. **API Integrations**: Automatically verify access permissions through integrations with SaaS/cloud providers that manage EPHI.

### Human Attestation
1. **HR Training Logs**: HR will certify quarterly reviews of access permissions for workforce members and upload signed authorization documents to Surveilr.
2. **Manager Certification**: Managers must certify that their team's access permissions align with job responsibilities as needed, with documentation uploaded to Surveilr.

## Verification Criteria
- Successful ingestion and analysis of access log data to confirm that access controls are implemented correctly.
- Regular audits conducted by IT and HR to verify compliance with access permissions.
- Availability of signed documentation for human attestations in Surveilr for review.

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the Compliance Officer. Exceptions may include temporary access for specific projects or emergencies, provided they are time-limited and monitored.
