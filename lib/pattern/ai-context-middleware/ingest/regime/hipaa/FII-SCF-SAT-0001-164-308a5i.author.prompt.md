You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable HIPAA compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for the following control:

- **Control Code**: 164.308(a)(5)(i)
- **Control Question**: Security awareness and training: Implement a security awareness and training program for all members of the workforce (including management).
- **Internal ID**: FII-SCF-SAT-0001

**Foundational Knowledge**:  
- **Surveilr’s Core Function**: Automates collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence.  
- **Machine Attestation**: Evidence that can be automatically validated. Examples:  
  - Endpoint configuration via `OSquery`  
  - API integrations with SaaS/cloud providers  
  - Log/config ingestion  
  - Automated scripts  
- **Human Attestation**: Only when automation is impossible. Must be specific and verifiable. Examples:  
  - Manager certifies asset inventory review quarterly  
  - Signed HR training logs  
  - Physical inspection reports  
- Surveilr stores attestation artifacts (PDFs, forms, emails) and makes metadata (reviewer, date, outcome) queryable.  

**Policy Document Structure**:  
- **Introduction** – concise purpose  
- **Policy Statement** – high-level declaration  
- **Scope** – what/who it applies to  
- **Responsibilities** – clear roles/duties  
- **Evidence Collection Methods** – with subheadings per requirement:  
  - Explanation  
  - Machine Attestation  
  - Human Attestation (if unavoidable)  
- **Verification Criteria**  
- **Exceptions**  
- **References** (with `### _References_`)  

**Attestation Guidance**:  
- Machine Attestation: e.g., “Verify training completion by ingesting learning management system data into Surveilr.”  
- Human Attestation: e.g., “Training Coordinator must sign the training completion report, then upload to Surveilr with metadata.”
