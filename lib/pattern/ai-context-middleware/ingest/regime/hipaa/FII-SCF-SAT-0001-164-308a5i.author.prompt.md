You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: 164.308(a)(5)(i) (FII: FII-SCF-SAT-0001). 

**Document Structure:**
1. **Introduction:** Concisely state the purpose of the policy, focusing on the importance of security awareness and training for all workforce members.
2. **Policy Sections:** Use H2 headings (##) for major requirements. Each section should:
   - Explain the control requirement regarding security awareness and training.
   - Suggest machine attestation methods (e.g., "Automatically track training completion through the Learning Management System (LMS) and store data in Surveilr").
   - Suggest human attestation methods where unavoidable (e.g., "The training coordinator must collect and upload signed training completion logs to Surveilr").
3. **Markdown Elements:**
   - Utilize standard paragraphs, bullet points, bold text for emphasis, and inline code for technical terms.
   - Format external references as [Link Text](URL).
4. **Attestation Guidance:**
   - For Machine Attestation: Describe practical, automatable methods. Examples:
     - "Utilize the LMS to verify completion of mandatory security training modules."
     - "Ingest system logs from the LMS to confirm user training participation."
   - For Human Attestation: Describe precise steps and artifacts. Examples:
     - "The training coordinator must ensure signed training completion logs are uploaded to Surveilr with metadata (review date, reviewer name)."

**Policy Requirements:**
1. **Format:** Clear sections (Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, References) in markdown format.
2. **Operational Detail and Specificity (MANDATORY SMART):** Replace general statements with Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART) instructions. Include a bulleted list of 3-5 operational steps for implementing training and a specific time-bound metric (KPI/SLA), such as "complete training within 30 days of hire."
3. **Comprehensive Scope Definition (MANDATORY):** Explicitly define the policy's scope to include all members of the workforce, including remote employees and third-party vendors.
4. **Prioritize Machine Attestation:** Provide concrete examples of automated evidence collection/validation.
5. **Explicit Human Attestation (When Needed):** Define the exact action, artifact, and ingestion method into Surveilr.
6. **Granular Roles and Cross-Referencing (MANDATORY):** Define specific, task-level duties for each role involved in the training process, and link to related organizational plans (e.g., Incident Response Plan).
7. **Policy Lifecycle Requirements (MANDATORY):** Include minimum data retention periods for training records (e.g., 'retain for 6 years') and mandatory frequency for policy review (e.g., 'reviewed at least annually').
8. **Formal Documentation and Audit (MANDATORY):** Require workforce member acknowledgment of training and comprehensive audit logging for critical actions.
9. **Attestation Descriptions Only:** Focus on methods, not SQL queries.
10. **Evidence Collection Methods:** Include subheadings per requirement, explaining the requirement, machine attestation approach, and human attestation if unavoidable.
11. **Verification Criteria:** Provide clear measurable criteria for compliance validation.
12. **Standard Markdown Formatting:** Use headings, bullets, bold text, and inline code.
13. **External References Format:** Use [Link Text](URL).
14. **References Section:** Conclude with a dedicated ### References section.
15. **End Document:** Ensure no additional content follows the References section.

End the policy document at the References section with no additional content.
