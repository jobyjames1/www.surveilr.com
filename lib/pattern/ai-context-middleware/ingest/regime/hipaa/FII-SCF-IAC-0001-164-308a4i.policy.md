# Information Access Management Policy for EPHI

## Introduction  
The purpose of this policy is to establish a framework for managing access to electronic protected health information (EPHI) in a manner that complies with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). This policy outlines the procedures for authorizing access to EPHI to ensure that only authorized personnel can access sensitive health information, thereby protecting patient privacy and maintaining the integrity of health data.

## Policy Statement  
Our organization is committed to implementing robust information access management practices that ensure compliance with HIPAA regulations. We recognize the critical importance of safeguarding EPHI and are dedicated to maintaining strict controls over who can access this information, thereby minimizing the risk of unauthorized access and potential breaches.

## Scope  
This policy applies to all personnel, systems, and processes that handle EPHI within the organization. This includes, but is not limited to:

- All employees, contractors, and third-party service providers with access to EPHI.
- All information systems, applications, and databases that store or process EPHI.
- Any processes or workflows involving the handling, sharing, or transmission of EPHI.

## Responsibilities  
- **Compliance Officer**: Responsible for overseeing the implementation and enforcement of this policy, including regular audits of access controls and user permissions.
- **IT Department**: Responsible for configuring and maintaining access control systems, ensuring that access permissions are granted based on role and necessity.
- **Department Managers**: Responsible for identifying personnel requiring access to EPHI within their teams and ensuring that access requests are submitted and justified.
- **All Personnel**: Required to comply with this policy and report any suspected unauthorized access to EPHI.

## Evidence Collection Methods  
### Explanation  
To demonstrate compliance with access authorization policies, the organization will implement evidence collection methods that ensure accurate monitoring and reporting of access activities.

### Machine Attestation  
- **Surveilr’s Core Function**: Automates collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence.  
- **Example**: "Verify user access rights by querying user permissions through integrations with Surveilr." This will enable real-time monitoring of access rights and facilitate audits.

### Human Attestation (if unavoidable)  
- **Example**: "The Compliance Officer must review access logs monthly and certify them, uploading the signed document to Surveilr with metadata." This manual check will serve as an additional layer of oversight.

## Verification Criteria  
To confirm compliance with this policy, the following criteria must be met:

- Access to EPHI is granted based on a clear justification related to job responsibilities.
- Regular audits of access logs are conducted and documented.
- Any changes to access permissions are logged and reviewed periodically.
- Compliance Officer certification of access logs is completed on a monthly basis.

## Exceptions  
Exceptions to this policy may be granted under specific circumstances, such as:

- Emergency situations where immediate access to EPHI is necessary for patient care, provided that such access is documented and reviewed afterward.
- Temporary access granted for system maintenance or troubleshooting, with appropriate documentation and oversight.
