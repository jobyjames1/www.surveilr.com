# Information Access Management Policy

## Introduction
This policy outlines the procedures for authorizing access to electronic protected health information (EPHI) in compliance with HIPAA regulations, specifically control code 164.308(a)(4)(i). The purpose of this policy is to ensure that access to EPHI is managed effectively, safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive health information.

## Policy Statement
All access to EPHI must be authorized and managed in accordance with HIPAA regulations and the specific requirements outlined in subpart E. Access will be granted only to individuals who require it for their job functions and will be regularly reviewed to maintain compliance.

## Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors who have access to EPHI in any form, including but not limited to electronic records, databases, and communication systems.

## Responsibilities
- **Compliance Officer**: Responsible for overseeing the implementation of this policy and ensuring compliance with HIPAA regulations.
- **IT Department**: Responsible for managing access controls, maintaining system configurations, and ensuring that systems handling EPHI are secure.
- **Department Managers**: Responsible for approving access requests and ensuring that their teams comply with this policy.
- **All Employees**: Responsible for adhering to the access management procedures and reporting any unauthorized access or security breaches.

## Evidence Collection Methods

### Explanation
The organization will implement machine and human attestation methods to gather evidence that access management policies are being adhered to. 

### Machine Attestation
- **Access Control Verification**: Utilize OSquery to validate that access controls are appropriately configured on systems containing EPHI. This includes querying user permissions and access logs to ensure that only authorized personnel have access.
- **API Integrations**: Implement API integrations with SaaS/cloud providers to monitor access and activity logs for EPHI access in real-time. These logs will be ingested into Surveilr for automated compliance reporting.
- **Log/Config Ingestion**: Regularly ingest system logs and configuration settings into Surveilr to provide a comprehensive overview of access management compliance.

### Human Attestation
- **Access Authorization Requests**: The Compliance Officer must review and approve all access authorization requests. A signed document certifying approval must be uploaded to Surveilr with relevant metadata (reviewer name, date, outcome).
- **Quarterly Reviews**: Department Managers must conduct quarterly reviews of access permissions for their teams and certify the review via a signed report uploaded to Surveilr.

## Verification Criteria
The organization will verify compliance with this policy through regular audits of machine and human attestations. Automated reports from Surveilr will be reviewed periodically to ensure that all access management practices are being followed and any discrepancies are addressed promptly.

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the Compliance Officer. Exceptions will be reviewed annually to determine if they are still warranted and if alternative solutions can be implemented.
