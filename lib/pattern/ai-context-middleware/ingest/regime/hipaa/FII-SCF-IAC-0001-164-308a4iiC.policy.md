# HIPAA Compliance Policy for Access Authorization

## Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to establish guidelines and procedures for implementing access authorization policies in accordance with HIPAA regulation 164.308(a)(4)(ii)(C). This policy ensures that user access to workstations, transactions, programs, or processes is appropriately authorized, documented, reviewed, and modified as necessary to protect sensitive health information.

## Policy Statement
Our organization is committed to maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of protected health information (PHI) through the implementation of robust access authorization policies. Access to sensitive systems and data will be strictly controlled and based on documented policies and procedures.

## Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors who require access to workstations, transactions, programs, or processes that handle PHI. It encompasses all systems and applications utilized within the organization that store or process PHI.

## Responsibilities
- **Access Control Manager**: Responsible for establishing, documenting, and maintaining access authorization policies and procedures. Ensures regular review and modification of user access rights.
- **IT Security Team**: Responsible for implementing technical controls that enforce access authorization policies and for monitoring compliance.
- **Employees and Contractors**: Responsible for adhering to access authorization policies and reporting any unauthorized access or security incidents.

## Evidence Collection Methods
- **Explanation**: Access authorization is managed through a combination of automated systems and manual processes. User access levels are defined based on role requirements and are documented in the access control management system.
  
- **Machine Attestation**: Compliance evidence is collected automatically through API integrations with relevant systems, such as user access logs from authentication servers. These logs are ingested into Surveilr for real-time monitoring and reporting.

- **Human Attestation (if unavoidable)**: The Access Control Manager must conduct an annual review of user access rights, document findings, and sign off on any modifications. This documentation is then uploaded to Surveilr with appropriate metadata for audit purposes.

## Verification Criteria
To verify compliance with access authorization policies, the following criteria must be met:
- Access authorization policies are documented and reviewed at least annually.
- User access rights are reviewed and updated as necessary based on job function changes, terminations, or other relevant factors.
- Evidence of automated machine attestation is available and up-to-date in Surveilr.
- Human attestations are documented and submitted as required.

## Exceptions
Exceptions to this policy may be made only with the approval of the Access Control Manager and must be documented. Temporary access for specific purposes (e.g., maintenance, troubleshooting) may be granted but must comply with the minimum necessary standard.

## Attestation Guidance
- **Machine Attestation**: “Verify user access levels by ingesting API logs into Surveilr.”
- **Human Attestation**: “Access Control Manager must document and sign the annual review of access rights, then upload to Surveilr with metadata.”

This policy is designed to ensure compliance with HIPAA regulations and to protect the integrity of PHI through effective access authorization management.
