# Access Authorization Policy

## Introduction  
The purpose of this policy is to establish and maintain a framework for managing user access to workstations, transactions, programs, and processes in accordance with HIPAA requirements. This policy ensures that access rights are appropriately authorized, documented, reviewed, and modified to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of protected health information (PHI).

## Policy Statement  
It is the policy of [Organization Name] to implement comprehensive access authorization policies and procedures that govern user access to information systems. These procedures are designed to ensure that access is granted based on the principle of least privilege and that users’ rights of access are reviewed and modified as necessary to maintain compliance with HIPAA regulations.

## Scope  
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party service providers of [Organization Name] who require access to workstations, transactions, programs, or processes that contain or interact with PHI. It encompasses all electronic and physical access points to sensitive information systems.

## Responsibilities  
- **Compliance Officer**: Oversee the implementation and enforcement of access authorization policies. Conduct quarterly reviews of user access and ensure documentation is complete and accurate.
- **IT Security Team**: Implement technical controls to enforce access policies. Facilitate machine attestation processes and ensure systems log appropriate access events.
- **Supervisors/Managers**: Review and certify user access changes, ensuring that only authorized personnel have access to necessary systems and data.
- **All Users**: Comply with access policies, reporting any unauthorized access or anomalies to management.

## Evidence Collection Methods

### Explanation  
To demonstrate compliance with access authorization policies, [Organization Name] will collect evidence through both automated and manual processes. This evidence will include access logs, user access level verification, and approval documentation.

### Machine Attestation  
- Verify user access levels through automated queries stored in Surveilr, ensuring that access rights correspond to documented roles within the organization.
- Utilize API integrations with cloud services to confirm access rights and permissions, providing real-time data on user access levels and modifications.

### Human Attestation (if unavoidable)  
- The Compliance Officer must document and sign user access reviews quarterly, ensuring that all findings are uploaded to Surveilr with appropriate metadata for future audits.
- Supervisors are required to certify access changes and submit supporting documentation to the Compliance Officer, ensuring that any modifications to user access rights are fully justified and recorded.

## Verification Criteria  
Compliance with the access authorization policy will be verified through the following criteria:
- Evidence of periodic reviews of user access rights and documentation of any modifications.
- Availability of automated logs that reflect user access levels and changes over time.
- Signed attestations from the Compliance Officer and supervisors confirming access reviews and changes.

## Exceptions  
Exceptions to this policy may be granted on a case-by-case basis, subject to approval from the Compliance Officer. Any exceptions must be documented, including the rationale for the exception, the duration, and any compensating controls implemented to mitigate risk.
