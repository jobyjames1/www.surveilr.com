You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "164.308(a)(3)(i)" (FII: FII-SCF-IAC-0008). The policy must include the following sections: 

1. **Introduction**: Concise purpose of the policy.
2. **Policy Statement**: Clear articulation of the policy requirements.
3. **Scope**: Comprehensive definition of the policy's scope, including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels for creating, receiving, maintaining, or transmitting EPHI.
4. **Responsibilities**: Define specific, task-level duties for each role mentioned, including links to related organizational plans.
5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: Subsections for each requirement explaining the control requirement, machine attestation methods, and human attestation methods where unavoidable.
6. **Verification Criteria**: Clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation.
7. **Exceptions**: Document any exceptions to the policy, including justification and approval.
8. **Attestation Guidance**: Methods for both machine and human attestation.
9. **Policy Lifecycle Requirements**: Minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs and mandatory frequency for policy review and update.
10. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Requirements for workforce member acknowledgment, comprehensive audit logging, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

The policy must maximize machine attestability while explicitly documenting where human attestation is unavoidable. Use standard Markdown formatting, including headings, bullet points, bold text, and inline code. End the policy document at the References section with no additional content, and if no external references exist, include a placeholder:
