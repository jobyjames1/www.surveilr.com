You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for the following control:

**Control Code**: 164.308(a)(3)(i)  
**Control Question**: Workforce security: Implement policies and procedures to ensure that all members of workforce have appropriate access to EPHI, as provided under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, and to prevent those workforce members who do not have access under paragraph (a)(4) of this section from obtaining access to electronic protected health information (EPHI). (R)  
**Internal ID**: FII-SCF-IAC-0008  

**Foundational Knowledge**:  
- **Surveilr’s Core Function**: Automates collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence.  
- **Machine Attestation**: Evidence that can be automatically validated. Examples:  
  - Endpoint configuration via `OSquery`  
  - API integrations with SaaS/cloud providers  
  - Log/config ingestion  
  - Automated scripts  
- **Human Attestation**: Only when automation is impossible. Must be specific and verifiable. Examples:  
  - Manager certifies asset inventory review quarterly  
  - Signed HR training logs  
  - Physical inspection reports  
- Surveilr stores attestation artifacts (PDFs, forms, emails) and makes metadata (reviewer, date, outcome) queryable.  

**Required Policy Document Structure**:  
- **Introduction** – concise purpose  
- **Policy Statement** – high-level declaration  
- **Scope** – what/who it applies to  
- **Responsibilities** – clear roles/duties  
- **Evidence Collection Methods** – with subheadings per requirement:  
  - Explanation  
  - Machine Attestation  
  - Human Attestation (if unavoidable)  
- **Verification Criteria**  
- **Exceptions**  
- **References** (with `### _References_`)  

**Attestation Guidance**:  
- Machine Attestation: e.g., “Verify user access to EPHI through regular audits of access logs stored in Surveilr.”  
- Human Attestation: e.g., “HR must certify workforce access reviews quarterly, then upload to Surveilr with metadata.”  

**Markdown and Formatting Rules**:  
- Use standard Markdown (headings, bullets, bold, inline code).  
- Use `[Link Text](URL)` for citations.  
- Do not include SQL queries.
