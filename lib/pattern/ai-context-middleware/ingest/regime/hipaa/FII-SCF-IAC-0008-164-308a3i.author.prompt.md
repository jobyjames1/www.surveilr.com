Generate a comprehensive HIPAA-compliant policy document for the control code 164.308(a)(3)(i) focused on Workforce Security. The document should include the following sections in markdown format: 

1. **Policy Statement**: Clearly state the purpose of the policy regarding access to electronic protected health information (EPHI) and the importance of workforce security.

2. **Scope**: Define the scope of the policy, including which workforce members it applies to and any exceptions.

3. **Responsibilities**: Outline the responsibilities of workforce members, management, and compliance officers in ensuring appropriate access to EPHI.

4. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - Detail machine attestation methods, emphasizing automation. For example, recommend using OSquery to collect and verify endpoint configurations and access controls regularly.
   - Suggest API integrations with cloud or SaaS providers to validate user access to EPHI automatically.
   - Describe how system logs can be ingested into Surveilr to confirm adherence to access control policies.

5. **Verification Criteria**: Specify how the evidence will be assessed and the criteria for compliance. For instance, identify regular audits using automated tools to ensure all workforce members have appropriate access.

6. **Exceptions**: Document any exceptions to the policy and the process for requesting them.

Incorporate human attestation methods where necessary. For example, specify that managers must sign a quarterly validation report confirming that workforce access to EPHI has been reviewed. Describe how this signed report is to be documented and uploaded to Surveilr, including the metadata that should be captured (reviewer name, date, and outcome).

Ensure the document maximizes machine attestability while clearly noting instances where human attestation is needed, along with the specifics of the actions, artifacts, and ingestion methods into Surveilr.

At the end of the document, include a section titled "References" for any external resources used. Use standard markdown elements, including paragraphs, bullet points, bold text for emphasis, and inline code for technical terms.
