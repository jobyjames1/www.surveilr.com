You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: 164.308(a)(3)(ii)(B) (FII: FII-SCF-IAC-0007). 

The policy document must include the following sections in clear markdown format: 

1. **Introduction**: Concise purpose of the policy.
2. **Policy Statement**: Statement defining the policy's intent.
3. **Scope**: Explicitly define the scope to include all relevant entities and environments, such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.
4. **Responsibilities**: Define specific, task-level duties for each role involved, using action verbs and frequency.
5. **Evidence Collection Methods**:
   - Explain the control requirement.
   - Suggest machine attestation methods (e.g., "Use OSquery to collect access logs daily").
   - Suggest human attestation methods where unavoidable (e.g., "Manager certifies quarterly access review").
6. **Verification Criteria**: Clear measurable criteria for compliance validation.
7. **Exceptions**: Document any exceptions and their justifications.
8. **Policy Lifecycle Requirements**: Include minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs and mandatory frequency for policy review and update.
9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for critical actions, and formal documentation for exceptions.
10. **References**: End with the section titled "### References".

Ensure that the policy maximizes machine attestability while explicitly documenting where human attestation is necessary, with detailed descriptions of methods for both. The policy must utilize SMART criteria when providing operational detail and specific instructions. Utilize standard markdown elements including headings, bullet points, bold text, and inline code for technical terms. 

The policy document must conclude at the References section with no additional content.
