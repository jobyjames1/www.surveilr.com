You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "164.308(a)(1)(ii)(C)" (FII: FII-SCF-HRS-0007). 

The policy must adhere to the following structure and guidelines:

1. **Document Structure:**
   - **Introduction:** Concise purpose of the policy.
   - **Policy Sections:** Use H2 headings (##) per major requirement. Each section should:
     - Explain the control requirement.
     - Suggest machine attestation methods (e.g., "Use OSquery to collect asset inventories daily").
     - Suggest human attestation methods where unavoidable (e.g., "Manager signs quarterly inventory validation report").
   - **References:** End with ### References.

2. **Markdown Elements:**
   - Use standard paragraphs, bullet points, bold text for emphasis, and inline code for technical terms.
   - Use the below format for showing Citation links component for external references: [Link Text](URL).

3. **Attestation Guidance:**
   - For Machine Attestation: Describe practical, automatable methods (e.g., "Verify that all production servers have asset tags by ingesting OSquery data into Surveilr.").
   - For Human Attestation: Describe precise steps and artifacts (e.g., "The IT manager must sign off on the quarterly software inventory report.").

4. **Format:** Clear sections (Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, References) in markdown format.

5. **Operational Detail and Specificity (MANDATORY SMART):** The policy MUST replace general statements with Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART) instructions.

6. **Comprehensive Scope Definition (MANDATORY):** Explicitly define the policy's scope to include ALL relevant entities and environments, covering cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems.

7. **Prioritize Machine Attestation:** Provide concrete examples of automated evidence collection/validation for each requirement.

8. **Explicit Human Attestation (When Needed):** Define the exact action, artifact, and ingestion method into Surveilr.

9. **Granular Roles and Cross-Referencing (MANDATORY):** The Responsibilities section MUST define specific, task-level duties for each role mentioned and explicitly link to related organizational plans.

10. **Policy Lifecycle Requirements (MANDATORY):** The policy MUST contain a dedicated subsection detailing minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs and mandatory frequency for policy review and update.

11. **Formal Documentation and Audit (MANDATORY):** The policy MUST require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance.

12. **Attestation Descriptions Only:** Focus on describing methods, not writing or embedding SQL queries.

13. **Evidence Collection Methods:** Include subheadings per requirement with explanations, machine attestation approaches, and human attestation descriptions if unavoidable.

14. **Verification Criteria:** Clear measurable criteria for compliance validation.

15. **Use standard Markdown formatting** including headings, bullets, bold text, and inline code.

16. **Use [Link Text](URL) format for external references.**

17. **End with ### References section.** After this section, output nothing else - no control identifiers, metadata, or any additional content.

Write the policy ensuring that it maximizes machine attestability while clearly documenting where human attestation is unavoidable. Ensure that the policy is comprehensive and precise, adhering to the guidelines above.
