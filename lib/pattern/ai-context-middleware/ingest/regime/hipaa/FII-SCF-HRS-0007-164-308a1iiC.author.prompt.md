Create a HIPAA-compliant policy document addressing Control Code 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(C), titled "Formal Sanctions." The document must be structured in Markdown format with the following sections: Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, and Exceptions. 

1. **Policy Statement**: Clearly articulate the necessity of formal sanctions for employees who fail to comply with security policies and procedures.

2. **Scope**: Define the individuals and departments to which this policy applies, ensuring clarity on who is responsible for compliance.

3. **Responsibilities**: Outline the roles responsible for enforcing this policy, including any specific duties related to monitoring compliance and administering sanctions.

4. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - Prioritize machine attestability by detailing automated methods for evidence collection. For example, describe how to use system logs or compliance management tools to track policy adherence.
   - Suggest methods like integrating with HR systems to monitor training compliance or using audit logs to verify sanction enforcement.

5. **Verification Criteria**: Specify how compliance with this policy will be verified. Include automated evidence collection methods such as:
   - "Utilize API integrations with HR systems to confirm that employees have received and acknowledged security policy training."
   - "Ingest system logs into Surveilr to review sanction application instances."

6. **Exceptions**: Clearly state any exceptions to the policy and the process for documenting these exceptions.

Ensure that the policy maximizes machine attestability while explicitly indicating instances where human attestation is necessary. For human attestation, provide specific actions, artifacts, and methods for documenting and ingesting these attestations into Surveilr, such as:
- "The HR manager must sign off on training completion logs, which are then uploaded to Surveilr with relevant metadata (review date, reviewer name)."

End the document with a section titled "References" for any external resources used.
