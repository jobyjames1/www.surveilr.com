# HIPAA Compliance Policy Document

## Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to establish a robust security management process that ensures the prevention, detection, containment, and correction of security violations in accordance with HIPAA control code 164.308(a)(1)(i). This policy outlines the necessary measures to safeguard protected health information (PHI) and maintain compliance with regulatory requirements.

## Policy Statement
It is the policy of [Organization Name] to implement and maintain comprehensive policies and procedures that effectively manage security risks associated with the handling of PHI. This includes proactive measures to prevent security violations, prompt detection of security incidents, timely containment of breaches, and corrective actions to mitigate future risks.

## Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party service providers who handle, manage, or have access to PHI within [Organization Name]. It encompasses all systems, applications, and processes involved in the management of PHI.

## Responsibilities
- **Compliance Officer**: Oversees the implementation and enforcement of this policy; ensures proper training and awareness among staff.
- **IT Security Team**: Responsible for the technical implementation of security controls; monitors systems for violations and anomalies.
- **Human Resources**: Manages training and awareness programs related to security policies and procedures.
- **All Employees**: Required to adhere to the established security policies and report any suspected security violations to the Compliance Officer.

## Evidence Collection Methods

### Explanation
To ensure compliance with the security management process, [Organization Name] will utilize a combination of machine and human attestation methods to collect evidence of policy enforcement and adherence.

### Machine Attestation
- **Configuration Data Ingestion**: Security controls will be verified by ingesting endpoint configuration data into Surveilr using automated tools such as `OSquery` to ensure compliance with security settings.
- **API Integrations**: Automated data collection from SaaS/cloud providers will be established to monitor and validate access controls and security configurations.
- **Log and Configuration Ingestion**: Continuous logging and monitoring of security events will be configured to detect any anomalies or unauthorized access attempts.
- **Automated Scripts**: Scripts will be utilized to assess compliance with security policies and generate reports for review.

### Human Attestation (if unavoidable)
- **Quarterly Policy Review**: The Compliance Officer must sign and certify the review of the security management policy on a quarterly basis. This document will be uploaded to Surveilr with accompanying metadata, including the reviewer's name, date of review, and the outcome.
- **Physical Inspection Reports**: Any physical security measures in place will be documented through inspection reports, signed by responsible personnel, and stored in Surveilr for verification.

## Verification Criteria
Compliance with this policy will be verified through regular audits, security assessments, and automated reporting generated from Surveilr. The Compliance Officer will review attestation artifacts for accuracy and completeness, ensuring that all security controls are functioning as intended.

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the Compliance Officer. Exceptions will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, with consideration given to potential risks and the impact on the security of PHI.
