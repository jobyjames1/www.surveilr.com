# HIPAA Compliance Policy for Security Management Process

## Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to establish a comprehensive security management process to ensure compliance with HIPAA regulations, particularly Control Code 164.308(a)(1)(i). This policy outlines the necessary measures to prevent, detect, contain, and correct security violations affecting protected health information (PHI).

## Policy Statement
It is the policy of [Organization Name] to implement and maintain effective policies and procedures that safeguard PHI against security violations. This includes the adoption of automated evidence collection mechanisms, as well as clear processes for human attestation when necessary.

## Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party service providers who access, manage, and process PHI within [Organization Name]. It encompasses all information systems and physical locations where PHI is stored, processed, or transmitted.

## Responsibilities
- **Compliance Officer**: Oversee the implementation of this policy and ensure compliance with HIPAA regulations.
- **IT Department**: Implement and maintain automated systems for evidence collection and ensure that all technical controls are functioning properly.
- **All Employees**: Adhere to the policies and procedures outlined in this document and report any suspected security violations promptly.

## Evidence Collection Methods

### Explanation
To uphold the integrity of our security management process, evidence must be collected through both automated and human attestation methods. This ensures that we can effectively monitor compliance and take corrective actions when necessary.

### Machine Attestation
1. **Endpoint Configuration**: Verify that production servers have required security agents installed by ingesting OSquery data into Surveilr. This automated process will continuously monitor and validate endpoint configurations against established security baselines.
  
2. **API Integrations**: Establish API connections with SaaS and cloud providers to automatically retrieve logs and configuration data. This integration will facilitate real-time evidence collection regarding security configurations and access controls.

3. **Log/Config Ingestion**: Automate the ingestion of security logs and configurations into Surveilr. This will allow for continuous monitoring and auditing of security events and system changes.

4. **Automated Scripts**: Develop and maintain automated scripts that regularly check for compliance with established security policies and procedures. Results will be stored as attestation artifacts within Surveilr.

### Human Attestation (if unavoidable)
1. **Quarterly Risk Assessment Review**: The Compliance Officer must sign the quarterly risk assessment report and upload it to Surveilr, including metadata such as the review date, reviewer name, and outcome of the assessment.

2. **Training Logs**: Signed HR training logs must be collected to verify that employees have completed required security training. These logs should be uploaded to Surveilr for record-keeping and compliance verification.

3. **Physical Inspections**: Conduct and document physical inspections of areas where PHI is stored. Inspection reports must be signed by the responsible party and submitted to Surveilr.

## Verification Criteria
Verification of compliance with this policy will be conducted through automated evidence collection and periodic audits. The Compliance Officer will ensure that evidence is regularly reviewed and that any identified security violations are addressed in a timely manner.

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the Compliance Officer. Exceptions will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the potential impact on PHI security.
