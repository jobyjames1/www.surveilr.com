# HIPAA Policy Document for Risk Analysis Compliance

## Introduction
This policy outlines the requirements and procedures for conducting a risk analysis as mandated by HIPAA control code 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A). The purpose of this document is to ensure that all risk analyses are conducted in accordance with NIST guidelines, thereby safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Protected Health Information (PHI).

## Policy Statement
All covered entities and business associates must perform a risk analysis to identify and mitigate risks to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic protected health information (ePHI). This analysis must be documented, reviewed, and updated regularly to ensure compliance with HIPAA regulations.

## Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party service providers who handle ePHI within the organization. It encompasses all systems, processes, and environments where ePHI is stored, processed, or transmitted.

## Responsibilities
- **Compliance Officer**: Oversees the risk analysis process and ensures compliance with HIPAA and NIST guidelines.
- **IT Security Team**: Conducts technical assessments and audits to identify vulnerabilities in systems handling ePHI.
- **All Employees**: Must be aware of and follow the procedures outlined in this policy.

## Evidence Collection Methods

### Explanation
Evidence of risk analysis must be collected to demonstrate compliance with HIPAA mandates. This evidence can be gathered through automated tools and manual processes, ensuring that both machine and human attestations are documented.

### Machine Attestation
- **Automated Risk Analysis Reports**: Utilize tools to generate reports on system vulnerabilities and risk assessments. These reports should be ingested into Surveilr as machine-attestable evidence.
- **Endpoint Configuration Verification**: Verify the configuration of endpoints using `OSquery` to ensure compliance with security controls as part of the risk analysis process.

### Human Attestation (if unavoidable)
- **Quarterly Risk Assessment Certification**: The Compliance Officer must sign the quarterly risk assessment report and upload it to Surveilr, including metadata such as the review date and outcomes.
- **Training Acknowledgment**: Employees must complete training on risk management and document their understanding through signed training logs, which should also be uploaded to Surveilr.

## Verification Criteria
To verify compliance with this policy, the following criteria will be used:
- Evidence of a completed risk analysis report that adheres to NIST guidelines.
- Documentation of machine attestation artifacts stored in Surveilr, including logs and configuration reports.
- Signed human attestation documents verifying the completion of required assessments.

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the Compliance Officer. Exceptions may be granted in cases where technology limitations hinder machine attestation or where specific circumstances necessitate alternative compliance measures.
