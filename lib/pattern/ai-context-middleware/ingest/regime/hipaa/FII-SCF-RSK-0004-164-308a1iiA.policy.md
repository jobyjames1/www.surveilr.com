# Risk Analysis Policy

## Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to establish guidelines for the completion of a risk analysis in accordance with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) guidelines, ensuring compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). This policy outlines the requirements for assessing risks to electronic protected health information (ePHI) and implementing appropriate measures to mitigate identified vulnerabilities.

## Control Requirement for Conducting a Risk Analysis
### Risk Assessment Process
The organization must conduct a comprehensive risk analysis as mandated by Control Code 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A). This analysis should identify potential risks and vulnerabilities to ePHI, assess the impact of these risks, and determine the likelihood of potential breaches. The risk analysis must be documented and updated regularly or whenever significant changes occur in the environment affecting ePHI.

### Machine Attestation Methods
To facilitate the risk analysis process, the organization is encouraged to utilize automated tools that can assist in identifying and assessing risks. Suggested methods include:
- **Vulnerability Scanning Tools**: Employ tools such as Nessus or Qualys to automatically scan systems for known vulnerabilities. The results should be ingested into our compliance tracking system, Surveilr, for analysis and documentation.
- **Automated Risk Assessment Tools**: Utilize platforms like RiskWatch or SecurityScorecard to gather continuous risk assessment data and generate reports that can be reviewed for compliance checks.

### Human Attestation Methods
In cases where automation is impractical or insufficient, human attestation is required. The following processes should be implemented:
- **Quarterly Reporting**: The risk management team must certify the completion of the risk analysis report on a quarterly basis. This report must be signed by the team lead and uploaded to Surveilr, including pertinent metadata such as the reviewerâ€™s name, review date, and outcome of the assessment.
- **Review and Sign-off**: The Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) must review the final risk analysis report, provide feedback, and sign the document. The signed report should be digitized and stored within Surveilr, ensuring all relevant metadata is included for tracking and future audits.

## Attestation Guidance

### Machine Attestation
To ensure machine attestability, the following methods should be adopted:
- **Centralized Vulnerability Management System**: Automate the collection of risk assessment results using a centralized system that consolidates data from various vulnerability scanning tools. This system should integrate seamlessly with Surveilr for compliance verification and tracking.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Implement continuous monitoring solutions that regularly assess the security posture and risk levels associated with ePHI, feeding real-time data into Surveilr.

### Human Attestation
The following actions and documentation procedures are required for human attestability:
- **Reporting Protocol**: The risk management team must compile the risk analysis report and submit it for review. The report should include a summary of findings, risk ratings, and recommended mitigation strategies.
- **Documentation Storage**: Upon approval from the CCO, the signed report should be digitized and uploaded to Surveilr, ensuring that all metadata related to the review process, including the reviewer's name, date of review, and any comments, is included for future reference.

By adhering to these structured guidelines, the organization will maintain compliance with HIPAA requirements while effectively managing risks to its information systems.
