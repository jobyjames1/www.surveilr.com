## Introduction

The purpose of this policy is to establish the requirements for conducting a risk analysis in compliance with NIST guidelines, ensuring the protection of electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI) across all relevant entities and environments.

## Requirement Overview

The control 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A) mandates that a comprehensive risk analysis be performed to identify vulnerabilities and threats to ePHI. This analysis must be completed in accordance with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) guidelines to safeguard sensitive information effectively.

## Evidence Collection Methods

### Requirement Explanation

Conducting a risk analysis is essential to understand the potential risks to ePHI and to implement appropriate security measures.

### Machine Attestation Approach

- Utilize **Surveilr** to automate the collection of risk assessment data.
- Integrate **NIST Special Publication 800-30** framework to ensure thorough risk assessments are conducted.
- Use **OSquery** to monitor changes in the environment that may affect risk levels, collecting data on configurations and vulnerabilities on a daily basis.

### Human Attestation (If Unavoidable)

- The Risk Management Officer must sign off on the annual risk analysis report.
- The signed report is to be uploaded to Surveilr, accompanied by metadata including the review date and reviewer name.

## Operational Steps

- Conduct a risk analysis in accordance with NIST guidelines at least annually.
- Document and review findings, categorizing risks by severity and impact within 30 days of completion.
- Implement identified remediation actions within 90 days of the risk analysis.
- Validate the effectiveness of implemented actions through follow-up assessments within 30 days post-remediation.
- Ensure all relevant stakeholders are trained on the findings and actions taken within 60 days of risk analysis completion.

## Scope Definition

This policy applies to all systems and environments that create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI, including:
- Cloud-hosted systems
- Software as a Service (SaaS) applications
- Third-party vendor systems (Business Associates)
- Internal systems and networks

## Roles and Responsibilities

- **Risk Management Officer**: 
  - Conducts risk assessments annually.
  - Documents findings and remediation plans.
  
- **IT Security Team**: 
  - Implements technical controls based on risk assessment findings.
  - Monitors compliance with security protocols daily.

- **Compliance Officer**: 
  - Reviews and approves the final risk analysis report.
  - Ensures that all documentation is retained for audit purposes.

- **All Workforce Members**: 
  - Acknowledge understanding and compliance with risk management policies and procedures.

### Related Organizational Plans

This policy is linked to the following plans for escalation and recovery:
- Incident Response Plan
- Disaster Recovery Plan

## Policy Lifecycle Requirements

- Evidence and logs related to risk analysis must be retained for a minimum of **6 years**.
- The policy must be reviewed and updated at least **annually**.

## Formal Documentation and Audit

- All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding and compliance with this policy.
- Comprehensive audit logging will be maintained for all critical actions related to risk analysis.
- Any exceptions to the policy must be formally documented, including justification, duration, and approval.

## Verification Criteria

- Successful completion of annual risk analysis as evidenced by signed reports in Surveilr.
- Compliance with remediation timelines and documentation of actions taken.
