# HIPAA Compliance Policy for Risk Analysis

## Introduction
This policy outlines the requirements and procedures for conducting a risk analysis as per the HIPAA regulation 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A). The purpose of this policy is to ensure that a thorough risk analysis is conducted in accordance with NIST guidelines, thereby safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of protected health information (PHI).

## Policy Statement
It is the policy of [Organization Name] to conduct a comprehensive risk analysis in alignment with NIST guidelines to identify potential risks and vulnerabilities to PHI. This analysis will be documented, maintained, and made available for auditing purposes to ensure compliance with HIPAA regulations.

## Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors of [Organization Name] who handle, manage, or have access to PHI. It encompasses all systems and processes that store, transmit, or process PHI.

## Responsibilities
- **Compliance Officer**: Responsible for overseeing the risk analysis process, ensuring adherence to NIST guidelines, and maintaining documentation for review.
- **IT Security Team**: Responsible for conducting the risk analysis, gathering data, and implementing security measures as identified in the analysis.
- **All Staff**: Required to report any potential risks or vulnerabilities related to PHI to the Compliance Officer or IT Security Team.

## Evidence Collection Methods

### Explanation
To ensure that the risk analysis is conducted and documented properly, evidence will be collected through both machine and human attestation methods.

### Machine Attestation
- Automated scripts will be deployed to collect and analyze system configurations and security controls. This includes:
  - Ingesting OSquery data into Surveilr to verify that security measures are in place and functioning effectively.
  - API integrations with SaaS/cloud providers to confirm that security settings meet compliance standards.
  - Log and configuration ingestion to maintain a record of system vulnerabilities and changes.

### Human Attestation (if unavoidable)
- The Compliance Officer must sign the quarterly risk assessment report to certify that the risk analysis has been completed in accordance with NIST guidelines. The signed report will then be uploaded to Surveilr along with relevant metadata (e.g., reviewer, date, outcome).

## Verification Criteria
- The risk analysis must be completed at least annually and whenever there are significant changes to technology, business practices, or regulatory requirements.
- Evidence of machine and human attestations must be stored in Surveilr and made available for audit purposes.
- The risk analysis report must demonstrate a clear understanding of potential risks and outline appropriate mitigation strategies.

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the Compliance Officer. Exceptions may be granted in cases where conducting a full risk analysis is not feasible due to resource constraints, provided that a justification is submitted and assessed.
