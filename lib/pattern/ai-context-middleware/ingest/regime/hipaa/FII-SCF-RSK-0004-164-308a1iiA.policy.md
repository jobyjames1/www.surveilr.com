# HIPAA Compliance Policy for Risk Analysis

## Introduction
This policy outlines the requirements for conducting a risk analysis in compliance with HIPAA standard 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A), ensuring that all processes align with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Guidelines.

## Policy Statement
It is the policy of [Organization Name] to conduct and document a thorough risk analysis in accordance with NIST Guidelines to identify and mitigate risks related to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of protected health information (PHI).

## Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party service providers who handle PHI or have access to systems that store or process PHI within [Organization Name].

## Responsibilities
- **Compliance Officer**: Responsible for overseeing the risk analysis process and ensuring compliance with HIPAA and NIST guidelines.
- **IT Security Team**: Responsible for implementing technical controls and providing necessary evidence for machine attestation.
- **All Staff**: Required to comply with the risk analysis process and provide necessary support as needed.

## Evidence Collection Methods

### Explanation
To demonstrate compliance with the risk analysis requirement, [Organization Name] will collect evidence through a combination of machine and human attestation methods.

### Machine Attestation
- **Automated Risk Assessment Tools**: Utilize automated tools to collect data on potential vulnerabilities and risks.
- **OSquery Data**: Verify that production servers have required agents installed by ingesting OSquery data into Surveilr. This data will include system configurations, software versions, and installed security patches.
- **API Integrations**: Integrate with cloud service providers to collect logs related to access and changes to systems that handle PHI.

### Human Attestation (if unavoidable)
- **Quarterly Risk Assessment Reports**: The Compliance Officer must sign the quarterly risk assessment report. This report will then be uploaded to Surveilr with metadata, including the reviewerâ€™s name, date, and outcome.
- **Training Logs**: Signed training logs for staff that detail HIPAA compliance training and risk awareness.

## Verification Criteria
- The risk analysis must be reviewed and updated at least annually or upon significant changes to the environment.
- Evidence of machine attestation must be stored in Surveilr and be easily queryable.
- Human attestations must include verifiable documentation uploaded to Surveilr.

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the Compliance Officer. Exceptions must be justified and include a plan for risk mitigation.
