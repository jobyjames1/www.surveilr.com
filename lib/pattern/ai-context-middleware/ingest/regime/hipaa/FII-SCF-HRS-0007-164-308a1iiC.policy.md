# Policy for Control 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(C)

## Introduction
This policy outlines the formal sanctions against employees who fail to comply with security policies and procedures. It is designed to ensure clarity, accountability, and compliance within the organization by establishing a structured method for addressing non-compliance.

## Policy Statement
All employees are required to adhere to the organization's security policies and procedures. Failure to comply with these policies will result in formal sanctions, which may include disciplinary actions up to and including termination of employment.

## Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors who have access to the organization's systems and data, including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and any third-party vendor systems utilized by the organization.

## Responsibilities
- **Human Resources (HR):** 
  - Develop and maintain documentation of disciplinary actions.
  - Ensure that workforce members acknowledge and attest to understanding the policies.
  
- **IT Security Team:** 
  - Monitor compliance with security policies and procedures.
  - Provide regular reports on compliance status to management.

- **Managers:** 
  - Enforce adherence to security policies within their teams.
  - Review and sign the compliance reports quarterly.

## Evidence Collection Methods

### Policy Acknowledgment
- **Machine Attestation:** 
  - Use an automated system to track employee acknowledgments of security policy documentation. Ensure the system logs the date and time of acknowledgment for each employee.
  
- **Human Attestation:** 
  - Require HR to maintain a signed record of policy acknowledgment from each employee, which must be updated annually.

### Compliance Monitoring
- **Machine Attestation:** 
  - Implement a compliance monitoring tool that automatically collects usage data from security policy-related systems. For example, use endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to monitor adherence to software installation policies.
  
- **Human Attestation:** 
  - Managers must review compliance reports quarterly and sign them to confirm that they have addressed any identified non-compliance issues.

### Disciplinary Action Documentation
- **Machine Attestation:** 
  - Maintain a centralized log of all disciplinary actions taken, automatically updated by HR systems whenever a sanction is applied.
  
- **Human Attestation:** 
  - HR must prepare a quarterly summary report of all disciplinary actions taken for non-compliance, which must be reviewed and approved by the Chief Compliance Officer.

## Verification Criteria
- **Compliance Rate:** 
  - Achieve a minimum of 95% compliance with security policy acknowledgments among all workforce members.
  
- **Disciplinary Action Reporting:** 
  - Ensure that all disciplinary actions are documented and reported within 30 days of occurrence.

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the Chief Compliance Officer. Exceptions must be reviewed annually for relevance and necessity.

## Policy Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention:** 
  - All evidence and logs related to policy compliance and disciplinary actions must be retained for a minimum of 5 years.
  
- **Policy Review Frequency:** 
  - This policy must be reviewed and updated annually or sooner if significant changes to security policies occur.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding and compliance with this policy through a formal attestation process. This acknowledgment must be documented and retained by HR for audit purposes.
