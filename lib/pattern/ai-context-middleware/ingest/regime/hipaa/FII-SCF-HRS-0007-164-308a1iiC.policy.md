# HIPAA Compliance Policy for Employee Sanctions

### Introduction
This policy outlines the formal sanctions imposed on employees who fail to comply with security policies and procedures, as mandated by HIPAA control code 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(C). The purpose of this policy is to establish a clear framework for enforcing compliance and ensuring the protection of sensitive health information.

### Policy Statement
The organization is committed to maintaining the highest standards of security and compliance with HIPAA regulations. To achieve this, formal sanctions will be enforced against employees who do not adhere to established security policies and procedures. This policy aims to deter non-compliance and promote a culture of accountability.

### Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors who have access to the organization’s sensitive health information and are required to comply with HIPAA security policies and procedures.

### Responsibilities
- **Human Resources (HR)**: Responsible for maintaining records of employee training, compliance acknowledgments, and sanctions.
- **Compliance Officer**: Oversees the enforcement of this policy and ensures adherence to HIPAA regulations.
- **Managers/Supervisors**: Responsible for monitoring employee compliance and reporting violations to HR and the Compliance Officer.

### Evidence Collection Methods

#### Explanation
To ensure the enforcement of sanctions against non-compliance, evidence must be collected to demonstrate that all employees are aware of the security policies and the consequences of failing to adhere to them.

#### Machine Attestation
- **Automated Compliance Records**: Surveilr will automatically verify that all employees have reviewed and acknowledged the security policies by ingesting compliance records. The metadata will include reviewer names, dates of acknowledgment, and outcomes of any compliance training.

#### Human Attestation (if unavoidable)
- **Sanction Documentation**: HR must maintain signed documentation of employee sanctions for non-compliance. This documentation will be uploaded to Surveilr with associated metadata, including the employee's name, date of sanction, and nature of the violation.

### Verification Criteria
- Regular audits will be conducted to verify that all employees have acknowledged security policies.
- HR will maintain an updated log of sanctions, which will be reviewed quarterly by the Compliance Officer.
- Any non-compliance incidents will be documented and assessed to determine appropriate sanctions.

### Exceptions
Exceptions to this policy must be approved in writing by the Compliance Officer. Requests for exceptions will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, considering the potential impact on HIPAA compliance and overall security posture.
