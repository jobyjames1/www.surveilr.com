# HIPAA Compliance Policy for Sanctions Against Employee Non-Compliance

## Introduction  
This policy establishes the framework for enforcing formal sanctions against employees who fail to comply with security policies and procedures within the organization, ensuring compliance with HIPAA Control Code 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(C).

## Policy Statement  
It is the policy of [Organization Name] to enforce formal sanctions against employees who do not adhere to established security policies and procedures. These sanctions are intended to promote a culture of compliance and security awareness among employees.

## Scope  
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and temporary staff at [Organization Name] who have access to sensitive information and are subject to the organization's security policies.

## Responsibilities  
- **Human Resources (HR)**: Responsible for the maintenance and enforcement of the sanctions policy, including documentation and reporting.
- **Compliance Officer**: Responsible for overseeing compliance with this policy and ensuring that sanctions are applied fairly and consistently.
- **Employees**: Responsible for understanding and adhering to security policies and procedures.

## Evidence Collection Methods  

### Explanation  
To ensure compliance with this policy, various methods of evidence collection will be utilized, with a focus on automated processes to reduce administrative burden.

  - **Log Ingestion**: Collect logs of employee access to sensitive information to monitor compliance with security protocols.

### Human Attestation (if unavoidable)

- **Documentation Maintenance**: HR must maintain signed documentation of sanctions against employees who fail to comply with security policies.
- **Quarterly Review Certification**: Managers will certify the review of employee compliance with security policies at least quarterly and upload signed certification to Surveilr with appropriate metadata.
