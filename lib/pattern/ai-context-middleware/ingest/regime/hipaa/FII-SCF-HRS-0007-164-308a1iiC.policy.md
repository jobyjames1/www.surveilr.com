# HIPAA Compliance Policy on Sanctions for Non-Compliance with Security Policies and Procedures

## Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to outline the formal sanctions imposed on employees who fail to comply with the organization’s security policies and procedures. This policy aims to ensure that all employees understand the importance of adherence to security protocols, thus safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of protected health information (PHI) as mandated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).

## Policy Statement
[Organization Name] is committed to maintaining the highest standards of security and compliance with HIPAA regulations. To enforce compliance with security policies and procedures, the organization has established formal sanctions for employees who violate these standards. Sanctions may range from verbal warnings to termination of employment, depending on the severity and frequency of the violation.

## Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and relevant stakeholders associated with [Organization Name]. It encompasses all activities and operations related to the handling of protected health information (PHI) and the adherence to security policies and procedures established by the organization.

## Responsibilities
- **Management**: Ensure that all employees are informed of the security policies and the consequences of non-compliance. Management is also responsible for enforcing the sanctions outlined in this policy.
- **Compliance Officers**: Monitor adherence to the policy and oversee the sanctioning process, including investigating incidents of non-compliance and documenting findings.

## Evidence Collection Methods
### Explanation
Evidence of compliance with this policy will be collected through a combination of automated systems and manual records. This ensures that there is a clear and auditable trail of all actions taken in relation to compliance and sanctions.

### Machine Attestation
- **Automated Tracking**: Utilization of Surveilr to automatically track employee acknowledgments of security policies. Employees will be required to acknowledge their understanding and acceptance of the policies, which will be logged within the Surveilr system.

### Human Attestation (if unavoidable)
- **Signed Acknowledgment Forms**: In cases where machine attestation is not feasible, such as for specific training sessions or disciplinary actions, HR will maintain signed records of employee compliance training and any sanctions imposed. These records will then be uploaded to Surveilr, ensuring proper metadata tagging for easy retrieval.

## Verification Criteria
Compliance with this policy will be verified through:
- Regular audits of Surveilr’s tracking logs to ensure all employees have acknowledged the relevant security policies.
- Review of incident reports and associated sanction records to evaluate the enforcement of sanctions for non-compliance.

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be formally requested in writing and submitted to the Compliance Officer for review. The request must provide a detailed explanation of the circumstances necessitating the exception. Approval or denial will be communicated in writing.
