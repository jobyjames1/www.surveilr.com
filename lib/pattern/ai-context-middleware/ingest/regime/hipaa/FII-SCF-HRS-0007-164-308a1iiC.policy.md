# Formal Sanctions Policy

## Policy Statement
This policy establishes the necessity of formal sanctions against employees who fail to comply with the organization's security policies and procedures. It is imperative to maintain the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of protected health information (PHI) and to ensure compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Non-compliance may result in disciplinary action, which can include verbal warnings, written reprimands, suspension, or termination of employment, depending on the severity of the violation.

## Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors who have access to the organization's systems and data containing PHI. Departments involved in implementing and enforcing this policy include Human Resources (HR), Information Technology (IT), Compliance, and any other relevant departments responsible for safeguarding PHI and enforcing security protocols.

## Responsibilities
- **Human Resources (HR)**: Responsible for maintaining records of employee training on security policies and for administering the sanctions process in coordination with management.
- **Information Technology (IT)**: Responsible for monitoring system logs, implementing automated compliance tools, and reporting non-compliance incidents.
- **Compliance Officer**: Ensures that the formal sanctions policy is enforced consistently and fairly, reviews incidents of non-compliance, and recommends appropriate sanctions.
- **Department Managers**: Responsible for ensuring their teams adhere to security policies and for reporting any violations.

## Evidence Collection Methods
- **Automated System Logs**: Utilize system logs to track user access and activities related to PHI. Automated tools will generate alerts for unauthorized access or policy violations.
- **Compliance Management Tools**: Integrate compliance management tools that automatically log training completion, policy acknowledgments, and sanction enforcement.
- **HR System Integration**: Connect with HR systems to monitor employee training compliance and maintain records of disciplinary actions taken.
- **Audit Logs**: Regularly review audit logs to verify that sanctions have been applied consistently and in accordance with this policy.

## Verification Criteria
- **Training Confirmation**: Utilize API integrations with HR systems to confirm that employees have received and acknowledged security policy training. The HR system must reflect that employees have completed relevant training modules.
- **Sanction Application Review**: Ingest system logs into Surveilr to review instances of sanction application. This includes tracking when sanctions were applied, the nature of the violation, and the outcome.
- **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular audits of compliance reports and sanction records to ensure adherence to this policy and identify areas for improvement.

## Exceptions
Exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the Compliance Officer. Situations that may warrant an exception include:
- Instances where an employee was unable to complete training due to documented medical or personal emergencies.
- Cases where a violation resulted from a documented system failure not attributable to user actions.

Documentation of exceptions must include:
- A detailed account of the circumstances leading to the exception.
- Signatures from the employee involved, their manager, and the Compliance Officer.
- Submission of this documentation to Surveilr with relevant metadata (review date, reviewer name).
