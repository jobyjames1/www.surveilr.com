You're an **official auditor (e.g., auditor)**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

  * **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
  * **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
      * **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
      * **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
      * **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
  * **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
      * **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
      * **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
      * **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
  * **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

  * **Audit Standard/Framework:** [Sample Audit Standard/Framework]
  * **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "To implement policies and procedures that prevent, detect, contain, and correct security violations, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI)."
Control Code: 164.308(a)(1)(i)
Control Question: Security management process: Implement policies and procedures to prevent, detect, contain, and correct security violations.
Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII): FII-SCF-GOV-0001, FII-SCF-GOV-0002
  * **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
    "This policy establishes a framework for implementing effective security management processes that prevent, detect, contain, and correct security violations related to electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI). The organization is committed to safeguarding ePHI through comprehensive security management processes, including daily monitoring of security logs and alerts, quarterly policy reviews, and regular vulnerability assessments."
  * **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "Evidence includes OSquery results showing endpoint configurations, daily security log review logs, the most recent signed quarterly security violation report, and vulnerability assessment results indicating compliance status."

**Requirements for Your Audit Report (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: [Sample Audit Standard/Framework] - 164.308(a)(1)(i)

**Overall Audit Result: [PASS/FAIL]**
**Date of Audit:** [Current Date, e.g., 2025-07-28]
**Auditor Role:** [Your designated auditor role, e.g., HIPAA Auditor]
**Control Code:** 164.308(a)(1)(i)
**Control Question:** Security management process: Implement policies and procedures to prevent, detect, contain, and correct security violations.
**Internal ID (FII):** FII-SCF-GOV-0001, FII-SCF-GOV-0002
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** To implement policies and procedures that prevent, detect, contain, and correct security violations, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI).

## 1. Executive Summary

[Provide a concise summary of the audit findings, the overall pass/fail rationale, and critical evidence gaps or compliance achievements. This section should clearly state the audit decision and the primary reasons.]

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

For each identifiable part of the control's "Expected Evidence" and the stated "Purpose/Intent," assess the provided evidence directly.

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Daily monitoring of security logs and alerts.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Daily security log review logs showing all entries for the past month.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** OSquery for endpoint data collection.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM security_logs WHERE review_date >= '2025-06-01';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** Evidence meets the requirement as the daily logs are well-documented and show consistent monitoring.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Documentation of quarterly policy reviews and updates.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Signed quarterly security violation report from the Compliance Officer.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Stored signed document in Surveilr.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The signed report confirms that the quarterly review took place and is properly documented.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Reports from vulnerability assessments indicating the status of systems.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Latest vulnerability assessment report showing all systems passed.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Automated report generation pulled from security tools.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The assessment report indicates full compliance with no vulnerabilities outstanding.

### 2.2 Human Attestation Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Signed acknowledgement of understanding and compliance with the policy by all workforce members.
    * **Provided Evidence:** A list of employees with signatures on the policy acknowledgement form.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** Each employee must sign the policy acknowledgment.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** Scanned copies of signed documents uploaded to Surveilr.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** All required signatures are present, verifying acknowledgment from the workforce.

## 3. Overall Alignment with Control's Intent Spirit

* **Assessment:** The provided evidence adequately demonstrates that the control's underlying purpose and intent are being met in practice.
* **Justification:** The evidence showcases a robust security management process consistent with the control's intent of preventing and managing security violations effectively.

## 4. Audit Conclusion and Final Justification

* **Final Decision:** PASS
* **Comprehensive Rationale:** All requirements were met with clear, documented evidence demonstrating compliance with the control. There were no gaps identified in machine attestable or human attestation evidence.

## 5. Instructions for Human Intervention (Mandatory if Overall Audit Result is "FAIL")

**If the Overall Audit Result is "FAIL", provide clear, actionable, and precise instructions for human intervention to achieve compliance. This section is an auditor's directive.**

* **Specific Missing Evidence Required:** 
    * [None, as the audit result is PASS.]
* **Specific Non-Compliant Evidence Required Correction:** 
    * [None, as the audit result is PASS.]
* **Required Human Action Steps:** 
    * [None, as the audit result is PASS.]
* **Next Steps for Re-Audit:** 
    * [Not applicable as the audit result is PASS.]
