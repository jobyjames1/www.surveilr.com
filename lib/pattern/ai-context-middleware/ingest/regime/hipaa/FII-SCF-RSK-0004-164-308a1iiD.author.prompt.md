You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(D) (FII: FII-SCF-RSK-0004). 

## Policy Structure
- **Introduction**: Provide a concise purpose of the policy regarding the review of IS activity records, including audit logs, access reports, and security incident tracking.
- **Policy Sections**: Use H2 headings (##) for each major requirement.
  - **Control Requirement**: Explain the necessity of regularly reviewing IS activity records.
  - **Evidence Collection Methods**:
    - **Machine Attestation**: Describe specific methods for automated evidence collection, such as:
      - "Use OSquery to collect and analyze audit logs daily."
      - "Integrate with cloud provider APIs to validate access control reports."
      - "Automate ingestion of security incident data into Surveilr for compliance tracking."
    - **Human Attestation**: Specify actions if automation is impractical, such as:
      - "A manager must sign a quarterly report certifying the review of access reports."
      - "All audit logs reviewed must be documented and uploaded to Surveilr, including metadata."
- **Verification Criteria**: Define clear, measurable criteria for validating compliance with the policy.
- **Scope**: Explicitly define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments, such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems.
- **Responsibilities**: Clearly delineate specific tasks for each role involved in compliance, linking to related organizational plans for escalation and recovery.
- **Policy Lifecycle Requirements**: Include data retention periods for evidence/logs and mandatory review frequencies.
- **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging, and formal documentation of exceptions.
