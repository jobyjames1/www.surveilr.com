description: "EPHI Protection Policies This control requires clearinghouses that are part of larger organizations to establish and enforce specific policies and procedures aimed at safeguarding electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI). These measures must ensure that ePHI is adequately protected from unauthorized access or misuse by the larger organization, thereby maintaining compliance with HIPAA regulations. Regular assessments and updates to these policies are essential to address evolving risks and ensure ongoing protection of ePHI."

You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable HIPAA compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for the following control:

- **Control Code**: 164.308(a)(4)(ii)(A) 
- **Control Question**: If you are a clearinghouse that is part of a larger organization, have you implemented policies and procedures to protect EPHI from the larger organization? (A)  
- **Internal ID**: FII-SCF-IAC-0001 

### Policy Document Structure

1. **Introduction**
   - Concise purpose of the policy.

2. **Policy Statement**
   - High-level declaration of the policy's intent.

3. **Scope**
   - Description of what/who the policy applies to.

4. **Responsibilities**
   - Clear roles and duties associated with the policy.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**
   - **Explanation**  
     - Describe how compliance is documented and monitored.  
   - **Machine Attestation**  
     - Automate evidence collection using Surveilr. For example: “Verify that EPHI protection measures are implemented by ingesting logs from security systems into Surveilr.”  
   - **Human Attestation (if unavoidable)**  
     - Specify any instances where human attestation is necessary. Example: “Compliance Officer must conduct an annual review of EPHI protection policies and sign off, then upload to Surveilr with metadata.”

6. **Verification Criteria**
   - Outline the criteria to assess compliance with the policy.

7. **Exceptions**
   - Detail any exceptions to the policy.

8. **References** 
   - Include relevant guidelines and standards, formatted as:  
     - `### _References_`  
     - [NIST Guidelines](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications)

### Attestation Guidance

- **Machine Attestation**: e.g., “Verify that EPHI protection protocols are effective by automating the collection of logs from firewall configurations into Surveilr.”  
- **Human Attestation**: e.g., “Compliance Officer must sign the annual EPHI protection policy review document and upload to Surveilr with the associated metadata.”  

Surveilr automates the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence, ensuring that machine attestation is preferred whenever possible. Human attestation should only be used when automation is not feasible and must be specific and verifiable. Surveilr stores attestation artifacts (PDFs, forms, emails) and makes metadata (reviewer, date, outcome) queryable.
