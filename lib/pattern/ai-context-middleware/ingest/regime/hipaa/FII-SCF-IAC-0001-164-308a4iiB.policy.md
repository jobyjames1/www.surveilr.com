# HIPAA Compliance Policy for Control 164.308(a)(4)(ii)(B)

## Introduction
This policy outlines the requirements and procedures for granting access to electronic protected health information (EPHI) as mandated by HIPAA control code 164.308(a)(4)(ii)(B). It aims to ensure that access is appropriately managed and monitored to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of EPHI.

## Policy Statement
The organization is committed to implementing comprehensive policies and procedures that govern access to EPHI. Access will be granted based on the principle of least privilege and in accordance with established roles and responsibilities.

## Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors who require access to EPHI as part of their job responsibilities. It includes all systems, workstations, applications, and processes that handle EPHI within the organization.

## Responsibilities
- **Compliance Officer**: Responsible for overseeing the implementation and enforcement of access policies.
- **IT Department**: Responsible for managing technical controls and ensuring systems are configured to enforce access restrictions.
- **Department Managers**: Responsible for approving access requests and ensuring compliance with access policies within their teams.
- **All Staff**: Required to adhere to the access policies and report any unauthorized access or anomalies.

## Evidence Collection Methods

### Explanation
To ensure compliance with the policy, evidence of access control implementation must be collected and validated regularly. This includes both automated and manual processes to maintain a thorough audit trail.

### Machine Attestation
- **Endpoint Configuration**: Verify that all workstations that access EPHI have the required security configurations in place. This will be done by ingesting OSquery data into Surveilr to confirm that all endpoints meet the access control standards.
- **Access Logs**: Automated ingestion of access logs from systems handling EPHI into Surveilr. This will allow for continuous monitoring and validation of access control compliance.

### Human Attestation (if unavoidable)
- **Quarterly Access Review**: The Compliance Officer will conduct a quarterly review of access permissions and document findings. The report must be signed and uploaded to Surveilr, including metadata such as the reviewer, date, and outcome.
- **Access Request Documentation**: Managers must maintain records of all access requests, approvals, and denials. These records should be stored and submitted to Surveilr for verification.

## Verification Criteria
- Confirmation that all endpoints accessing EPHI are compliant with security configurations.
- Availability of access logs in Surveilr that demonstrate adherence to access policies.
- Signed quarterly access review reports stored in Surveilr.

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the Compliance Officer. Exceptions should be justified and include a plan for remediation or alternative controls to mitigate risks related to EPHI access.
