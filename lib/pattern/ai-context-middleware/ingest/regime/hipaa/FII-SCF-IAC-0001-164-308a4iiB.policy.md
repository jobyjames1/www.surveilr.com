# HIPAA Compliance Policy Document  
**Control Code**: 164.308(a)(4)(ii)(B)  
**Internal ID**: FII-SCF-IAC-0001  

## Introduction  
The purpose of this policy is to establish a framework for granting access to Electronic Protected Health Information (EPHI) in compliance with HIPAA regulations. This policy aims to safeguard patient data by ensuring that access is appropriately controlled and monitored.

## Policy Statement  
It is the policy of [Organization Name] to implement and maintain robust policies and procedures for granting access to EPHI. Access to EPHI will be granted based on the principle of least privilege, ensuring that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive information necessary for their job functions.

## Scope

## Responsibilities  
- **Compliance Officer**: Oversee the implementation and adherence to access control policies and procedures.  
- **IT Department**: Manage technical access controls and monitor compliance with access policies.  
- **Department Managers**: Review and approve access requests to ensure alignment with job responsibilities.  
- **All Staff**: Adhere to access control policies and report any unauthorized access incidents.

## Evidence Collection Methods  

### Explanation  
To demonstrate compliance with access control policies, [Organization Name] will utilize a combination of machine and human attestations to validate the implementation of access controls.

### Machine Attestation  
- **Automated Reports**: Access control lists and permissions will be verified through automated reports generated by the organizationâ€™s system. These reports will be ingested into Surveilr for ongoing compliance monitoring.  
- **Endpoint Configuration**: Regular audits of endpoint configurations via tools like OSquery will be performed to ensure adherence to access control policies.

### Human Attestation (if unavoidable)  
- **Annual Review Certification**: The Compliance Officer will certify the annual review of access control policies by signing a certification form. This form will be uploaded to Surveilr along with metadata detailing the reviewer, date, and outcome.  
- **Training Logs**: Signed training logs documenting staff participation in access control training will be maintained and uploaded to Surveilr for verification.

## Verification Criteria  
To verify compliance with this policy, the following criteria will be assessed:  
1. Completeness and accuracy of automated reports on access controls.  
2. Evidence of annual review certification by the Compliance Officer.  
3. Availability of signed training logs for staff who have access to EPHI.

## Exceptions
