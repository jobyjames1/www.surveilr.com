# HIPAA Compliance Policy Document

## Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to establish a comprehensive security awareness and training program for all members of the workforce, including management, to ensure compliance with HIPAA control code 164.308(a)(5)(i). This program aims to enhance the understanding of security risks and promote best practices in safeguarding sensitive health information.

## Policy Statement
All members of the workforce are required to participate in a security awareness and training program. This program will be designed to provide the necessary knowledge and skills to recognize and respond to potential security threats, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of protected health information (PHI).

## Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and affiliated personnel who have access to PHI and related systems within the organization. It encompasses all levels of workforce members, including management.

## Responsibilities
- **Training Coordinator**: Responsible for developing and implementing the security awareness and training program, as well as maintaining training records.
- **Management**: Responsible for ensuring that all team members complete the required training and adhere to security policies.
- **Employees**: Responsible for actively participating in training sessions and applying learned practices in their daily activities.

## Evidence Collection Methods

### Explanation
To ensure compliance with the training requirements, evidence of training completion and effectiveness must be collected and stored. This includes both automated and manual methods of verification.

### Machine Attestation
- **Training Completion Verification**: The organization will automate the collection of training completion data by integrating the learning management system (LMS) with Surveilr. This allows for real-time querying of training status, ensuring that all workforce members are up-to-date with their security awareness training.
- **Log Ingestion**: Security logs from the LMS will be ingested into Surveilr, providing a continuous record of training activities.

### Human Attestation (if unavoidable)
- **Manual Certification**: If automation is not possible for specific training sessions, the Training Coordinator will compile a training completion report. This report must be signed by the Training Coordinator and uploaded to Surveilr, accompanied by metadata detailing the completion date, reviewer, and outcomes.

## Verification Criteria
- All workforce members must complete the security awareness and training program annually.
- Evidence of training completion will be verified through automated data collection from the LMS and manual certification when necessary.
- A compliance review will be conducted quarterly to assess training effectiveness and completion rates.

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the Training Coordinator and Management. Exceptions may be granted under specific circumstances, such as temporary workforce absences or system outages affecting training access.
