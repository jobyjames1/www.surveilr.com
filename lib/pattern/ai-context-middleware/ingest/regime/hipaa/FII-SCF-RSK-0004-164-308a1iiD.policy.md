# HIPAA Compliance Policy for IS Activity Review

## Introduction
This policy outlines the procedures for regularly reviewing records of information system (IS) activity, including audit logs, access reports, and security incident tracking, to ensure compliance with HIPAA regulation 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(D).

## Policy Statement
To maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive data, our organization will implement and enforce procedures to regularly review IS activity records. These reviews are essential for identifying unauthorized access, detecting anomalies, and ensuring compliance with HIPAA regulations.

## Scope
This policy applies to all personnel, systems, and processes involved in the management and oversight of IS activity records within our organization. This includes IT staff, compliance officers, and any third-party vendors who handle sensitive information on behalf of the organization.

## Responsibilities
- **IT Department**: Responsible for the collection, storage, and analysis of IS activity records.
- **Compliance Officer**: Ensures adherence to this policy and oversees the review process.
- **All Staff**: Required to report any anomalies or security incidents to the compliance officer.

## Evidence Collection Methods

### Explanation
Regular reviews of IS activity records are critical for identifying security incidents and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. The reviews will include audit logs, access reports, and records of security incidents.

### Machine Attestation
- **Audit Logs**: Utilize automated scripts to collect and analyze audit logs from all critical systems. Logs will be ingested into Surveilr for ongoing monitoring and querying.
- **Access Reports**: Implement API integrations with cloud service providers to retrieve access logs automatically. These reports will be stored in Surveilr for validation.
- **Security Incident Tracking**: Automated incident response tools will log security incidents, which will be monitored and reviewed regularly through Surveilr.

### Human Attestation (if unavoidable)
- The Compliance Officer must certify the quarterly review of IS activity records and upload the signed report to Surveilr with metadata indicating the date of review and the outcome.

## Verification Criteria
Verification of compliance with this policy will be conducted by:
- Reviewing logs stored in Surveilr to ensure all records are being captured and analyzed.
- Ensuring that all automated systems are functioning correctly and that evidence can be queried as needed.
- Confirming that human attestations are properly documented and uploaded.

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the Compliance Officer. Exceptions will be reviewed periodically to determine if they are still necessary.
