# HIPAA Compliance Policy Document

## Introduction
This policy outlines the procedures for regularly reviewing records of information system (IS) activity, including audit logs, access reports, and security incident tracking, to ensure compliance with HIPAA regulations and to enhance the security posture of the organization.

## Policy Statement
The organization is committed to maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of protected health information (PHI) by implementing and enforcing procedures that facilitate regular reviews of IS activity records. This is to ensure compliance with HIPAA Control Code 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(D).

## Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party service providers who have access to the organizationâ€™s information systems and are responsible for managing or accessing PHI.

## Responsibilities
- **Compliance Officer**: Responsible for overseeing the implementation of this policy, ensuring that review processes are followed and documented.
- **IT Security Team**: Responsible for conducting the reviews of IS activity records and reporting findings to the Compliance Officer.
- **All Staff**: Required to support the compliance efforts and report any discrepancies or security incidents to the IT Security Team.

## Evidence Collection Methods

### Explanation
Regular reviews of IS activity records are essential for identifying unauthorized access and ensuring compliance with HIPAA regulations. The organization will utilize automated tools and processes to facilitate these reviews.

### Machine Attestation
- **Audit Log Review**: Implement automated scripts to ingest audit log data into Surveilr for ongoing analysis. This process will ensure that access logs are reviewed regularly, with findings documented and stored as machine-attested evidence.
- **Access Reports**: Integrate with endpoint management systems via API to pull access reports regularly into Surveilr, enabling continuous monitoring and automated reporting of access patterns.
- **Security Incident Tracking**: Use automated log ingestion to track security incidents and maintain records within Surveilr for review.

### Human Attestation
- **Quarterly Review Report**: The Compliance Officer must review the findings from the automated processes quarterly. A report certifying the review must be signed and uploaded to Surveilr, including relevant metadata such as reviewer name, date, and outcome.

## Verification Criteria
- Evidence of regular IS activity record reviews will be verified through:
  - Ingested data from audit logs and access reports in Surveilr.
  - Signed quarterly review reports by the Compliance Officer.
  - Documentation of security incidents and their resolutions.

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the Compliance Officer, ensuring that alternative measures are in place to maintain compliance.
