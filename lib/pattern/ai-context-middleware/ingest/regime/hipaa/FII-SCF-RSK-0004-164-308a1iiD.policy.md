# Information System Activity Review Policy

## Introduction

The purpose of this policy is to govern the regular review of information system activity records, including audit logs, access reports, and security incident tracking. Regularly reviewing these records is essential for identifying unauthorized access, ensuring compliance with regulatory standards, and maintaining the overall security posture of the organization.

## Control Requirement Explanation

Regular reviews of information system activity records are crucial for detecting anomalies and ensuring that systems are functioning as intended. By systematically examining these records, organizations can:

- Identify potential security breaches or inappropriate access.
- Ensure compliance with HIPAA regulations and other legal requirements.
- Maintain the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive data.

## Machine Attestation Methods

To maximize efficiency and accuracy in the review process, the following automated methods are recommended for evidence collection:

- **Use `OSquery` to automatically collect and review audit logs weekly.**
- **Integrate with cloud service APIs to retrieve access reports for validation.**
- **Ingest system logs into `Surveilr` for ongoing compliance monitoring.**
  
These methods provide a continuous and reliable means of verifying that information system activity is being adequately monitored.

### Attestation Guidance for Machine Attestation

- Confirm that all system logs are reviewed weekly by automatically ingesting data into `Surveilr`.
- Cross-check access logs against a predefined list of authorized users using automated scripts.

## Human Attestation Methods

In instances where automation is impractical, human actions are required to ensure compliance. The following human attestation methods are necessary:

- **The security manager shall certify quarterly that all audit logs have been reviewed, with a signed report submitted to `Surveilr`.**
- **Document inspection of security incident tracking logs, with reports uploaded to `Surveilr` including metadata (reviewer name, date, outcome).**

### Attestation Guidance for Human Attestation

- The IT security manager must sign the quarterly review report of IS activity logs.
- Upload the signed report to `Surveilr`, ensuring metadata (review date, reviewer name) is attached.
