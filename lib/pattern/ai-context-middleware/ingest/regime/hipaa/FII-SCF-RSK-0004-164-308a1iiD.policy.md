## Policy for Control: 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(D) (FII: FII-SCF-RSK-0004)

### Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to establish guidelines for the regular review of information system (IS) activity records, including audit logs, access reports, and security incident tracking. This ensures that organizations can effectively monitor and manage security events, maintain compliance, and enhance overall security posture.

## Control Requirement
Regularly reviewing IS activity records is essential for identifying unauthorized access, detecting anomalies, and ensuring compliance with internal and external security policies. This proactive approach helps organizations mitigate risks and respond swiftly to potential security incidents.

## Evidence Collection Methods

### Machine Attestation
To streamline the evidence collection process, the following automated methods will be employed:
- **Use OSquery** to collect and analyze audit logs daily, providing insights into system activity.
- **Integrate with cloud provider APIs** to validate access control reports, ensuring that access permissions align with organizational policies.
- **Automate ingestion of security incident data** into Surveilr for compliance tracking, allowing for real-time monitoring and reporting.

### Human Attestation
In scenarios where automation is impractical, the following human attestations will be required:
- A **manager must sign a quarterly report** certifying the review of access reports, confirming that manual evaluations have been conducted.
- All reviewed audit logs must be **documented and uploaded to Surveilr**, including relevant metadata to ensure traceability and accountability.

## Verification Criteria
Compliance with this policy will be validated through the following measurable criteria:
- Evidence of daily automated collection and analysis of audit logs.
- Documentation of quarterly access report reviews signed by a manager.
- Records of all audit logs reviewed, including timestamps and responsible personnel.

## Scope
This policy applies to all entities and environments within the organization, including:
- Cloud-hosted systems
- Software as a Service (SaaS) applications
- Third-party vendor systems

## Responsibilities
- **IT Security Team**: Responsible for implementing automated evidence collection methods and monitoring compliance.
- **Managers**: Responsible for certifying quarterly reviews of access reports and ensuring documentation is maintained.
- **Compliance Officer**: Responsible for overseeing the adherence to this policy and conducting regular audits.

## Policy Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: All evidence and logs must be retained for a minimum of five years to comply with regulatory requirements.
- **Review Frequencies**: Automated logs must be reviewed daily, while access reports must be reviewed quarterly.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding and compliance with this policy. Comprehensive audit logs must be maintained, and any exceptions to this policy must be formally documented and reviewed.
