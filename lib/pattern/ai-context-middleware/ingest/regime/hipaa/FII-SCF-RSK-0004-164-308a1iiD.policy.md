# HIPAA Compliance Policy for IS Activity Records Review

## Introduction
This policy establishes the framework for the regular review of information system (IS) activity records, including audit logs, access reports, and security incident tracking, to ensure compliance with HIPAA regulations and enhance the security posture of the organization.

## Policy Statement
The organization is committed to implementing robust procedures for the regular review of IS activity records. This includes systematic analysis of audit logs, access reports, and security incidents to identify potential security threats, ensure compliance with HIPAA requirements, and maintain the integrity of sensitive patient information.

## Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party service providers who have access to the organization’s information systems and data. It encompasses all IS activity records relevant to HIPAA compliance.

## Responsibilities
- **IT Security Team**: Responsible for the collection, analysis, and reporting of IS activity records. They will ensure that audit logs and access reports are reviewed regularly.
- **Compliance Officer**: Responsible for overseeing the adherence to this policy, ensuring that the review processes are implemented effectively, and that documentation is maintained for compliance.
- **All Staff**: Required to report any irregularities or security incidents identified within IS activity records to the IT Security Team.

## Evidence Collection Methods

### Explanation
Collecting evidence regarding the review of IS activity records is critical for demonstrating compliance with HIPAA requirements. It ensures that the organization can provide verifiable proof of its efforts to monitor and secure sensitive information.

### Machine Attestation
- **Automated Evidence Collection**: The organization will utilize Surveilr to automate evidence collection. For example, “Verify that audit logs are ingested into Surveilr on a daily basis for analysis.” This process will allow for real-time monitoring and assessment of IS activities.

### Human Attestation (if unavoidable)
- **Necessary Human Attestations**: In instances where automated measures cannot capture all required evidence, human attestations will be employed. For example, “The IT Manager must certify the quarterly review of access reports and upload the signed document to Surveilr.” This ensures accountability and provides a clear audit trail.

## Verification Criteria
Compliance with this control will be verified through:
- Regular audits of IS activity records to ensure that reviews are conducted as per the established schedule.
- Documentation of findings from the reviews, including any identified security incidents and resolutions.
- Confirmation that automated evidence collection processes are functioning correctly and that human attestations are duly completed and stored.

## Exceptions
No exceptions to this policy will be permitted unless specifically authorized by the Compliance Officer, who must document the rationale for any deviations.

## Attestation Guidance

### Machine Attestation
- “Verify that all access reports are automatically ingested into Surveilr for real-time monitoring.” This will ensure that access to sensitive information is continuously tracked and analyzed.

### Human Attestation
- “The Compliance Officer must sign the annual security incident report and upload it to Surveilr with complete metadata.” This document will serve as a formal record of compliance and incident management.
