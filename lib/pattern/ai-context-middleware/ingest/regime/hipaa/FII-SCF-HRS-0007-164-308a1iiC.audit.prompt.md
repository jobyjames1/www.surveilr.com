You're an **official auditor**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

  * **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
  * **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
      * **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
      * **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
      * **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
  * **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
      * **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
      * **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
      * **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
  * **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

  * **Audit Standard/Framework:** [HIPAA Compliance]
** Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "[Formal sanctions against employees who fail to comply with security policies and procedures to ensure accountability and compliance.]"
Control Code: 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(C)
Control Question: Do you have formal sanctions against employees who fail to comply with security policies and procedures? (R)
Internal ID (Foriegn Integration Identifier as FII): FII-SCF-HRS-0007
  * **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
    "[This policy outlines the formal sanctions against employees who fail to comply with security policies and procedures. It establishes a structured method for addressing non-compliance, requiring all employees to adhere to security policies, with disciplinary actions for violations. Evidence includes automated tracking of policy acknowledgments, compliance monitoring reports, and documentation of disciplinary actions.]"
  * **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "[Evidence includes machine attestations of employee policy acknowledgment via automated logs, quarterly compliance monitoring reports signed by managers, and HR logs of disciplinary actions taken for non-compliance.]"


**Requirements for Your Audit Report (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: HIPAA Compliance - 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(C)

**Overall Audit Result:** [PASS]
**Date of Audit:** [2023-10-05]
**Auditor Role:** [HIPAA Auditor]
**Control Code:** [164.308(a)(1)(ii)(C)]
**Control Question:** [Do you have formal sanctions against employees who fail to comply with security policies and procedures? (R)]
**Internal ID (FII):** [FII-SCF-HRS-0007]
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** [Formal sanctions against employees who fail to comply with security policies and procedures to ensure accountability and compliance.]

## 1. Executive Summary

The audit findings indicate that the organization has successfully implemented the necessary controls to enforce formal sanctions against employees who fail to adhere to security policies and procedures. The evidence provided demonstrates a high level of compliance with the control's requirements, reflecting both machine and human attestations that adequately support the organization's commitment to security compliance.

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** [Automated tracking of employee acknowledgments of security policy documentation.]
    * **Provided Evidence:** [Automated logs showing employee policy acknowledgment dates and times for 95% of employees.]
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** [Utilized automated system for tracking policy acknowledgments.]
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** [Query results indicating the count of employees who acknowledged the policy versus total workforce.]
    * **Compliance Status:** [COMPLIANT]
    * **Justification:** [The automated logs substantiate that over 95% of employees have acknowledged the security policies, fulfilling the requirement for formal acknowledgment.]

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** [Regular reports on compliance status from managers.]
    * **Provided Evidence:** [Quarterly compliance reports signed by managers confirming adherence.]
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** [Reports generated through compliance monitoring tools.]
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** [SQL query retrieving compliance rates from the monitoring tool.]
    * **Compliance Status:** [COMPLIANT]
