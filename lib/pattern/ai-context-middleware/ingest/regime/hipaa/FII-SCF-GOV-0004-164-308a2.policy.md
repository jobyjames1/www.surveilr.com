# Assigned Security Responsibility Policy

## Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to establish the assignment of security responsibility within our organization in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Identifying a dedicated security official is crucial for the development and implementation of policies and procedures that ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of protected health information (PHI).

## Policy Statement
It is the policy of [Organization Name] to assign a qualified security official responsible for overseeing and implementing the necessary policies and procedures to comply with HIPAA standards as per Control Code 164.308(a)(2). This security official will be tasked with ensuring that all security measures are effectively integrated into the organization’s operations.

## Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party service providers of [Organization Name] who handle or have access to PHI. It encompasses all operational areas where PHI is created, received, maintained, or transmitted.

## Responsibilities
- **Security Official**: The designated security official is responsible for:
  - Developing, implementing, and maintaining the organization’s security policies and procedures.
  - Ensuring compliance with HIPAA security standards.

  - Automatically log any changes in security personnel using **HR management software** integrated with Surveilr, maintaining a record of personnel changes for accountability.

    - Review date
    - Reviewer name
  - Additional certifications may be required following significant policy updates or changes in security personnel.

## Verification Criteria
Compliance with this policy will be verified through a combination of automated and manual methods:

- Review of the signed attestation documents stored in Surveilr to confirm that the security official has maintained their responsibilities annually.
- Periodic assessments of the effectiveness of security policies and procedures, including risk assessment reports.
