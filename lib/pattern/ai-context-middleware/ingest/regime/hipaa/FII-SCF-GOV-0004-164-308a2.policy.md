# HIPAA Compliance Policy Document  
**Control Code**: 164.308(a)(2)  
**Internal ID**: FII-SCF-GOV-0004, FII-SCF-HRS-0003  

## **Introduction**  
This policy outlines the requirements for identifying and documenting the security official responsible for the development and implementation of compliance policies and procedures as mandated by HIPAA. The purpose is to ensure that a designated individual carries the accountability for safeguarding protected health information (PHI) and adhering to relevant regulations.

## **Policy Statement**  
The organization shall appoint a Security Official who will be responsible for the development, implementation, and oversight of security policies and procedures in alignment with HIPAA requirements. This individual will be the primary point of contact for security compliance matters and will ensure that all necessary safeguards for PHI are enacted and maintained.

## **Scope**  
This policy applies to all organizational staff, including management, personnel involved in the development of security policies, and any employees who handle PHI. The policy is applicable across all departments within the organization.

## **Responsibilities**  
- **Security Official**:  
  - Develop and implement security policies and procedures that comply with HIPAA regulations.
  - Serve as the main contact for all security-related inquiries within the organization.
  - Oversee the compliance and training of staff on security policies.

- **Management**:  
  - Support the Security Official in policy implementation and compliance efforts.
  - Ensure that resources are allocated to fulfill security responsibilities effectively.

- **All Employees**:  
  - Comply with security policies and procedures as outlined.
  - Report any security incidents or breaches to the Security Official immediately.

## **Evidence Collection Methods**  
### **Explanation**  
To validate compliance with this policy, evidence must be collected that demonstrates the assignment and responsibilities of the Security Official. 

### **Machine Attestation**  
- **OSquery Data Ingestion**: Verify that the Security Official has been assigned and documented by ingesting OSquery data into Surveilr. This data should reflect the role and responsibilities of the Security Official within the organization.

### **Human Attestation (if unavoidable)**  
- The designated Security Official must sign the policy implementation report, confirming their understanding and acceptance of their responsibilities. This signed document should be uploaded to Surveilr, along with relevant metadata (reviewer, date, outcome).

## **Verification Criteria**  
- Successful ingestion of OSquery data into Surveilr demonstrating the assignment of the Security Official.
- Signed policy implementation report uploaded to Surveilr for verification.
- Regular reviews and updates of the Security Official's responsibilities to ensure ongoing compliance.

## **Exceptions**  
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by senior management. Exceptions may only be granted in cases where compliance is not feasible and must be justified with valid reasoning.
