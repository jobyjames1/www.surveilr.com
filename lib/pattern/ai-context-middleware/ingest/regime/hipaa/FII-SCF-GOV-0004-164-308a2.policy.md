## Introduction
This policy outlines the responsibilities and protocols for identifying and designating a security official responsible for the development and implementation of security policies and procedures in compliance with HIPAA control 164.308(a)(2).

## Policy Statement
It is the policy of [Entity Name] to ensure that a designated security official is responsible for overseeing the development and implementation of policies and procedures that safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of protected health information (PHI).

## Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors of [Entity Name] who have access to PHI or are involved in the development and implementation of HIPAA compliance measures.

## Responsibilities
- **Security Official**: The designated individual responsible for overseeing HIPAA compliance, including the development and implementation of relevant policies and procedures.
- **Compliance Officer**: Responsible for ensuring all compliance documentation is maintained and attested to in Surveilr.
- **Department Heads**: Ensure their teams are aware of and comply with the established security policies and procedures.

## Evidence Collection Methods

### Machine Attestation

- **Automated Reporting**: Generate automated reports from Surveilr regarding policy implementation status and security official responsibilities.

### Human Attestation (if unavoidable)

## Verification Criteria

- Human attestations must be specific, verifiable, and included in the compliance evidence stored in Surveilr.
