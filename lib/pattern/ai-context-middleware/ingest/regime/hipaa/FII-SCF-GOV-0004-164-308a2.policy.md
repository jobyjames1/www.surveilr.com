# HIPAA Compliance Policy Document  
## Control Code: 164.308(a)(2)  
### Assigned Security Responsibility

### **Introduction**  
This policy outlines the responsibilities for the identification and designation of the security official responsible for the development and implementation of HIPAA policies and procedures as required by Control Code 164.308(a)(2). The intent is to ensure compliance with HIPAA regulations while enabling a clear structure for security responsibilities within the organization.

### **Policy Statement**  
It is the policy of [Entity Name] to appoint a qualified security official responsible for the development and implementation of policies and procedures to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic protected health information (ePHI) in accordance with HIPAA regulations.

### **Scope**  
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and affiliates of [Entity Name] who have access to ePHI and are involved in the development and implementation of security policies and procedures.

### **Responsibilities**  
- **Security Official**: The designated security official is responsible for the following:
  - Development and implementation of security policies and procedures.
  - Regular review and updates of security measures in accordance with evolving regulations and best practices.
  - Oversight of training and awareness programs related to security policies.

- **Management**: Management is responsible for supporting the security official in the execution of their duties by providing necessary resources and authority.

### **Evidence Collection Methods**  

#### **Explanation**  
To ensure compliance with the assigned security responsibility, evidence of the designated security official's role and responsibilities must be collected and maintained in a verifiable manner.

#### **Machine Attestation**  
- **Data Verification**: The designated security official's role and responsibilities will be validated by ingesting HR data into Surveilr. This includes verifying the job title, department, and responsibilities associated with the security role.
- **Automated Reporting**: Surveilr will generate automated reports that outline the current security official and their responsibilities, ensuring up-to-date compliance evidence.

#### **Human Attestation (if unavoidable)**  
- The designated security official must sign the policy implementation document annually. This signed document will then be uploaded to Surveilr, including metadata such as the reviewer, date, and outcome of the review.

### **Verification Criteria**  
- Evidence must be collected and stored in Surveilr, allowing for automated querying of the security official's role and responsibilities.
- The signed policy implementation document must be available for review, demonstrating human attestation where machine attestation is not feasible.

### **Exceptions**  
There are no exceptions to this policy. All designated security responsibilities must be adhered to without deviation.
