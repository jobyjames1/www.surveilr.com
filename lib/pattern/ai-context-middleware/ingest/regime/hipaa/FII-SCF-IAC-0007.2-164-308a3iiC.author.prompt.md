You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: 164.308(a)(3)(ii)(C) (FII: FII-SCF-IAC-0007.2). 

The policy document must include the following structure and details:

1. **Introduction**: Provide a concise purpose of the policy.
2. **Policy Sections**: Use H2 headings (##) for each major requirement. Each section should:
   - Explain the control requirement.
   - Suggest machine attestation methods (e.g., "Use OSquery to collect access logs daily").
   - Suggest human attestation methods where unavoidable (e.g., "HR must maintain a signed termination acknowledgment form").
3. **Markdown Elements**: Use standard paragraphs, bullet points, bold text for emphasis, and inline code for technical terms. Format external references as [Link Text](URL).
4. **Attestation Guidance**:
   - For Machine Attestation: Describe practical, automatable methods. Examples:
     - "Verify that employee access to EPHI is disabled within 24 hours of termination by automating access logs into Surveilr."
     - "Audit user accounts weekly to ensure compliance with access termination policies."
   - For Human Attestation: Describe precise steps and artifacts. Examples:
     - "The HR manager must sign off on the termination checklist."
     - "Signed checklists are uploaded to Surveilr with metadata (review date, reviewer name)."
5. **Format**: Ensure clear sections (Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, References) in markdown format.
6. **Operational Detail and Specificity**: Replace general statements with Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART) instructions. Include a bulleted list of 3-5 operational steps and specific time-bound metrics for processes.
7. **Comprehensive Scope Definition**: Define the policy's scope to cover cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.
8. **Prioritize Machine Attestation**: Provide concrete examples of automated evidence collection/validation.
9. **Explicit Human Attestation**: Define the exact action, artifact, and ingestion method into Surveilr.
10. **Granular Roles and Cross-Referencing**: Specify task-level duties for each role mentioned and link to related organizational plans for escalation and recovery.
11. **Policy Lifecycle Requirements**: Detail minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs and mandatory frequency for policy review and update.
12. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.
13. **Attestation Descriptions Only**: Focus on describing methods without writing SQL queries.
14. **Evidence Collection Methods**: Include subheadings per requirement with explanations, machine attestation approaches, and human attestation if unavoidable.
15. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear measurable criteria for compliance validation.
16. **Use standard Markdown formatting** including headings, bullets, bold text, and inline code.
17. **End with a References section**: The References section is the FINAL section of the policy document. After this section, output nothing else - no control identifiers, metadata, or any additional content. If no external references exist, include a placeholder: ### References followed by None. 

Ensure that the policy maximizes machine attestability while explicitly documenting where human attestation is unavoidable, along with the method and its limitations.
