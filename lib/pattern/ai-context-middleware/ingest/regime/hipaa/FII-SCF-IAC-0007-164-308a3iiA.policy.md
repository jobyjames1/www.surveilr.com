# HIPAA Compliance Policy: Authorization and Supervision of Employees Working with ePHI

## Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to establish a framework for the authorization and supervision of employees who have access to electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI) or work in locations where ePHI might be accessed. Compliance with this policy is essential to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI as mandated by HIPAA regulations.

## Policy Statement
It is the policy of [Organization Name] to implement and maintain effective procedures for the authorization and supervision of employees who interact with ePHI, ensuring that appropriate access controls are enforced and personnel are adequately trained and supervised to handle sensitive information responsibly.

## Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and agents of [Organization Name] who have access to ePHI or work in environments where ePHI might be accessed. This includes all physical and digital locations where ePHI is stored, processed, or transmitted.

## Responsibilities
- **Compliance Officer**: Oversee the implementation and enforcement of this policy.
- **HR Department**: Manage employee authorization processes, training, and record-keeping.
- **IT Department**: Ensure technological measures for access control and supervision are properly implemented and maintained.
- **Supervisors/Managers**: Monitor employee compliance with ePHI handling procedures and provide oversight.

## Evidence Collection Methods

### Explanation
To demonstrate compliance with the authorization and supervision procedures, [Organization Name] will utilize a combination of machine and human attestation methods to collect evidence.

### Machine Attestation
- **Endpoint Configuration**: Verify that employee access controls are configured properly by ingesting OSquery data into Surveilr. This includes monitoring user permissions and access logs to ensure only authorized personnel have access to ePHI.
- **API Integrations**: Utilize API integrations with SaaS/cloud providers to automatically verify that access controls and user roles are appropriately set and maintained.

### Human Attestation (if unavoidable)
- **Quarterly Access Review**: The HR Manager must review and certify employee access authorization logs quarterly. This includes verifying that only authorized personnel have access to ePHI and that training has been completed. Signed logs must be uploaded to Surveilr with relevant metadata, including the reviewer, date, and outcome.
- **Training Records**: Maintain signed training logs demonstrating that employees have successfully completed training on ePHI handling. These records must be uploaded to Surveilr with necessary metadata.

## Verification Criteria
To verify compliance with this policy, [Organization Name] will:
- Regularly audit the machine-attested evidence collected via Surveilr.
- Conduct periodic reviews of human attestation records for accuracy and completeness.
- Ensure that any discrepancies or issues identified during audits are promptly addressed and remediated.

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the Compliance Officer. Exceptions may be granted in cases where specific operational needs necessitate alternate procedures, provided that such exceptions do not compromise the security of ePHI.
