# Policy for Authorization and Supervision of Employees Working with EPHI

## Introduction
This policy outlines the procedures for the authorization and supervision of employees who work with Electronic Protected Health Information (EPHI) or in locations where EPHI might be accessed. This ensures compliance with HIPAA regulations and protects sensitive patient information.

## Policy Statement
It is the policy of [Organization Name] to implement robust procedures for the authorization and supervision of employees who have access to EPHI. This will help mitigate risks associated with unauthorized access and ensure that all employees are appropriately trained and monitored.

## Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors who have access to EPHI or work in locations where EPHI may be accessed. 

## Responsibilities
- **Compliance Officer**: Oversees the implementation of this policy and ensures adherence to HIPAA requirements.
- **HR Department**: Manages employee training and certification processes.
- **IT Department**: Implements technical controls and monitors compliance through automated means.

## Evidence Collection Methods

### Authorization Procedures
#### Explanation
Authorization procedures include verifying the identity of employees and ensuring they have the appropriate level of access to EPHI based on their job responsibilities.

#### Machine Attestation
- **Endpoint Configuration**: Verify that access controls are configured and operational using `OSquery` data ingested into Surveilr.
- **API Integrations**: Use API logs from cloud services to confirm that only authorized personnel have access to EPHI.

#### Human Attestation (if unavoidable)
- **Access Request Forms**: Managers must sign access request forms for employees, which are then uploaded to Surveilr with metadata including the reviewer's name and date of approval.

### Supervision Procedures
#### Explanation
Supervision procedures include ongoing monitoring of employees who have access to EPHI to ensure compliance with organizational policies and training requirements.

#### Machine Attestation
- **Log Ingestion**: Regularly ingest logs that capture user activity related to EPHI access into Surveilr for automated analysis and reporting.
- **Automated Scripts**: Deploy scripts that check for unusual access patterns and alert relevant personnel.

#### Human Attestation (if unavoidable)
- **Quarterly Reviews**: Compliance Officers must sign and certify quarterly supervision reports, which are then uploaded to Surveilr with relevant metadata.

## Verification Criteria
- Automated evidence collection methods must show 100% compliance with access control configurations.
- Human attestations must be completed and uploaded within the specified reporting periods.

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the Compliance Officer. Exceptions will be reviewed annually to determine if ongoing risk mitigation procedures are needed.
