# HIPAA Compliance Policy Document for Control 164.308(a)(3)(ii)(A)

## **Introduction**
This policy outlines the procedures for the authorization and supervision of employees who work with Electronic Protected Health Information (EPHI) or in locations where it might be accessed. It ensures compliance with HIPAA requirements while leveraging Surveilr for effective evidence collection and management.

## **Policy Statement**
The organization is committed to implementing and maintaining procedures for the authorization and supervision of employees who interact with EPHI. This policy aims to safeguard sensitive health information from unauthorized access and ensure that all personnel have the necessary training and supervision to handle such information responsibly.

## **Scope**
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors who have access to EPHI or work in areas where EPHI is stored or processed. It encompasses all locations, systems, and operational processes involving EPHI.

## **Responsibilities**
- **Compliance Officer**: Oversees the implementation of authorization and supervision procedures, monitors compliance, and ensures regular audits are conducted.
- **Human Resources (HR)**: Responsible for employee training and maintaining records of training completion and employee roles concerning EPHI access.
- **IT Department**: Implements technical controls and ensures that machine attestation methods are in place for monitoring compliance.
- **Supervisors/Managers**: Ensure that employees under their supervision are properly trained and authorized to access EPHI.

## **Evidence Collection Methods**

### **1. Authorization Procedures**
#### **Explanation**
The organization will define and document the criteria for employee access to EPHI based on job roles and responsibilities.

#### **Machine Attestation**
- Verify the role-based access control configurations in all systems handling EPHI by ingesting logs from the access management system into Surveilr.

#### **Human Attestation**
- HR must maintain signed acknowledgment forms from employees regarding their access rights and responsibilities, to be uploaded to Surveilr with metadata.

### **2. Supervision Procedures**
#### **Explanation**
Supervision procedures will be established to ensure that employees with access to EPHI are regularly monitored and supervised by qualified personnel.

#### **Machine Attestation**
- Utilize API integrations with monitoring tools to collect data on user activity related to EPHI access, which will be ingested into Surveilr for validation.

#### **Human Attestation**
- Supervisors must conduct quarterly reviews of employee access logs and submit signed reports to Surveilr, including metadata about the reviewer and date.

## **Verification Criteria**
- Compliance will be verified through automated reports generated by Surveilr, logging any unauthorized access attempts, and confirming that all personnel have completed required training and authorization processes.
- Human attestations will be reviewed during internal audits to ensure their accuracy and completeness.

## **Exceptions**
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the Compliance Officer. These exceptions will be evaluated based on the risks associated with EPHI access and supervision.
