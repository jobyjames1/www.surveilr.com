You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "Has the risk management process been completed using IAW NIST Guidelines? (R)" (FII: FII-SCF-RSK-0004).

## Introduction
- Clearly state the purpose of the policy regarding the risk management process in accordance with NIST guidelines.

## Policy Sections
### Risk Management Process Requirement
- Describe the control requirement for completing the risk management process.
- **Machine Attestation Methods:** 
  - Suggest using automated tools to collect risk assessment data and validate completion status.
  - Example: "Utilize system logs to verify that risk assessments are conducted at defined intervals."
- **Human Attestation Methods:** 
  - Define actions required when automation is impractical, such as managerial sign-off on risk management documentation.

### Evidence Collection Methods
- **Explanation of Requirement:** 
  - Outline the necessity for a documented risk management process.
- **Machine Attestation Approach:** 
  - Describe how evidence of risk assessments can be automatically collected and verified.
  - Example: "Ingest risk assessment reports into Surveilr for validation."
- **Human Attestation (if unavoidable):** 
  - Specify documentation and methods for human attestation, such as signed reports.

### Verification Criteria
- Detail measurable criteria for compliance validation, such as "Risk assessments must be completed quarterly, with reports submitted for review."

## Responsibilities
- Define specific, task-level duties for roles involved in the risk management process.
  - Example: "Compliance Officer: Review risk management reports quarterly; IT Security: Conduct risk assessments bi-annually."

## Policy Lifecycle Requirements
- Detail minimum data retention periods for risk assessment documentation (e.g., "retain for 6 years").
- Specify mandatory frequency for policy review and update (e.g., "reviewed at least annually").

## Formal Documentation and Audit
- Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance with the policy.
- Mandate comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions related to risk management.
