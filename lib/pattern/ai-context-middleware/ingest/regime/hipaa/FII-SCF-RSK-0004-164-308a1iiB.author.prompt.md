Generate a HIPAA-compliant policy document addressing the control code 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(B) titled "Risk Management Process." The policy must include the following sections in markdown format: 

1. **Policy Statement**: Clearly state the purpose and intent of the risk management process in compliance with HIPAA and NIST guidelines.

2. **Scope**: Define the applicability of this policy, including who it affects within the organization.

3. **Responsibilities**: Outline the roles and responsibilities of individuals involved in the risk management process.

4. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - Provide detailed machine attestability methods. For instance, describe how to collect evidence of risk assessments and mitigation strategies using automated tools such as OSquery for system configurations and vulnerabilities.
   - Suggest utilizing API integrations with cloud service providers to validate the implementation of security controls and risk management documentation.
   - Detail the automation of logging processes, ensuring that logs related to risk assessments are ingested into Surveilr for compliance validation.

5. **Verification Criteria**: 
   - State how the organization will verify that the risk management process is completed according to NIST guidelines, emphasizing machine attestability through automated checks.
   - Highlight the importance of ensuring that any manual processes are documented effectively.

6. **Exceptions**: Describe scenarios under which exceptions to this policy may be allowed, including how these exceptions will be managed and documented.

Where human attestation is necessary, specify the exact actions that must be taken, such as:
- A designated manager must sign off on risk assessment reports quarterly, and these signed documents must be uploaded to Surveilr, including metadata such as reviewer name, date, and outcome.
- Include any other necessary human interactions, detailing how these will be recorded and stored in Surveilr.

Ensure the policy maximizes machine attestability while explicitly documenting human attestation instances, including methods and limitations. Use clear markdown formatting, bullet points for clarity, and inline code for technical terms. End the document with a references section labeled "### _References_."
