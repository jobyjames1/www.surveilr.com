You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "Assigned security responsibility: Identify the security official who is responsible for the development and implementation of the policies and procedures required by this subpart for the entity." (FII: FII-SCF-GOV-0004, FII-SCF-HRS-0003). 

Please structure the policy document as follows:

1. **Introduction**: Provide a concise purpose of the policy.
   
2. **Policy Sections**: Use H2 headings (##) for major requirements. Each section should:
   - Explain the control requirement.
   - Suggest machine attestation methods (e.g., "Use OSquery to collect asset inventories daily").
   - Suggest human attestation methods where unavoidable (e.g., "Manager signs quarterly inventory validation report").

3. **Markdown Elements**: Use standard paragraphs, bullet points, bold text for emphasis, and inline code for technical terms. Format citation links as [Link Text](URL).

4. **Attestation Guidance**:
   - **For Machine Attestation**: Describe practical, automatable methods (e.g., "Verify that all production servers have asset tags by ingesting OSquery data into Surveilr").
   - **For Human Attestation**: Describe precise steps and artifacts (e.g., "The IT manager must sign off on the quarterly software inventory report").

5. **Format**: Clearly separate sections (Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, References) in markdown format.

6. **Operational Detail and Specificity (MANDATORY SMART)**: The policy must contain specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) instructions, including:
   - A bulleted list of 3-5 operational steps.
   - A specific time-bound metric (KPI/SLA).

7. **Comprehensive Scope Definition (MANDATORY)**: Define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments, covering cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels for ePHI.

8. **Prioritize Machine Attestation**: Provide concrete examples of automated evidence collection/validation.

9. **Explicit Human Attestation (When Needed)**: Define the action, artifact, and ingestion method into Surveilr.

10. **Granular Roles and Cross-Referencing (MANDATORY)**: Define specific task-level duties for each role mentioned and link to related organizational plans.

11. **Policy Lifecycle Requirements (MANDATORY)**: Include minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs and mandatory frequency for policy review and update.

12. **Formal Documentation and Audit (MANDATORY)**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for critical actions, and formal documentation for exceptions.

13. **Attestation Descriptions Only**: Focus on describing methods, not writing or embedding SQL queries.

14. **Evidence Collection Methods**: Include subheadings per requirement with:
   - Explanation of the requirement.
   - Machine Attestation approach.
   - Human Attestation (if unavoidable).

15. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear measurable criteria for compliance validation.

16. **Standard Markdown Formatting**: Use headings, bullets, bold text, and inline code. 

17. **References Section**: End with ### References. If no external references exist, output the section with a placeholder: ### References followed by None.

Please ensure the policy document ends at the References section with no additional content.
