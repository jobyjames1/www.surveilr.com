You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable HIPAA compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for the following control:

**Control Code**: 164.308(a)(2)  
**Control Question**: Assigned security responsibility: Identify the security official who is responsible for the development and implementation of the policies and procedures required by this subpart for the entity.  
**Internal ID**: FII-SCF-GOV-0004, FII-SCF-HRS-0003  

**Surveilr’s Core Function**: Automates collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence.  
**Machine Attestation**: Evidence that can be automatically validated. Examples:  
- Endpoint configuration via `OSquery`  
- API integrations with SaaS/cloud providers  
- Log/config ingestion  
- Automated scripts  

**Human Attestation**: Only when automation is impossible. Must be specific and verifiable. Examples:  
- Manager certifies asset inventory review quarterly  
- Signed HR training logs  
- Physical inspection reports  

Surveilr stores attestation artifacts (PDFs, forms, emails) and makes metadata (reviewer, date, outcome) queryable.  

**Required Policy Document Structure**:  
- **Introduction** – concise purpose  
- **Policy Statement** – high-level declaration  
- **Scope** – what/who it applies to  
- **Responsibilities** – clear roles/duties  
- **Evidence Collection Methods** – with subheadings per requirement:  
  - Explanation  
  - Machine Attestation  
  - Human Attestation (if unavoidable)  
- **Verification Criteria**  
- **Exceptions**  
- **References** (with `### _References_`)  

**Attestation Guidance**:  
- Machine Attestation: e.g., “Verify security official roles and responsibilities by ingesting HR data into Surveilr.”  
- Human Attestation: e.g., “The designated security official must sign the policy implementation document, then upload to Surveilr with metadata.”
