Generate a HIPAA-compliant policy document that addresses the control code 164.308(a)(2), titled "Assigned Security Responsibility." The document must identify the security official responsible for the development and implementation of the policies and procedures required by this subpart for the entity. 

**Structure the policy document using the following guidelines:**

1. **Front Matter (YAML Header):** Include the following required metadata fields:
   - title: "Assigned Security Responsibility Policy"
   - weight: 1
   - description: "Policy outlining the assigned security responsibility for HIPAA compliance."
   - publishDate: "2025-09-09"
   - publishBy: "Compliance Automation Team"
   - classification: "Confidential"
   - documentVersion: "v1.0"
   - documentType: "Policy"
   - approvedBy: "Chief Compliance Officer"
   - category: ["Policy Authoring", "Compliance Automation", "Surveilr"]
   - satisfies: [FII-SCF-GOV-0004, FII-SCF-HRS-0003]
   - merge-group: "system-author-meta-prompts"
   - order: 1

2. **Introduction:** Provide a concise purpose of the policy, explaining the significance of identifying a security official for HIPAA compliance.

3. **Policy Sections:** Use H2 headings (##) for the following major sections:
   - **Policy Statement:** Clearly articulate the policy regarding the assignment of security responsibility.
   - **Scope:** Define who this policy applies to within the organization.
   - **Responsibilities:** Specify the roles and responsibilities of the security official and any relevant team members.
   - **Evidence Collection Methods:** 
     - Describe machine attestation methods, such as:
       - "Use API integrations to verify the security official's identity and role within the organization."
       - "Automatically log any changes in security personnel using HR management software integrated with Surveilr."
     - Where human attestation is necessary, specify:
       - "The security official must sign a document certifying their responsibilities annually. This signed document will be scanned and uploaded to Surveilr, with metadata including the review date and reviewer name."
   - **Verification Criteria:** Explain how compliance with this policy will be verified, emphasizing the collection of machine evidence where possible.
   - **Exceptions:** Outline any exceptions to the policy and the process for approving them.

4. **References:** Include a section at the end of the document labeled "### _References_" for any external resources cited.

**Ensure that the document maximizes machine attestability while clearly outlining instances where human attestation is required. Use clear and concise language, standard markdown elements (bulleted lists, bold text, inline code for technical terms), and focus on describing evidence collection methods without embedding SQL queries.**
