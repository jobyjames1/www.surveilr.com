You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "3.1.1e" (FII: "FII-SCF-BCD-0011.8"). 

The policy document must include the following sections in this exact order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit,** and **References**. 

1. **Introduction**: Provide a clear overview of the policy's purpose and importance regarding dual authorization for the deletion or destruction of sensitive backup media and data.

2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly articulate the organization's stance on implementing and enforcing dual authorization for sensitive data handling.

3. **Scope**: Explicitly define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments, covering cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit sensitive data.

4. **Responsibilities**: Define specific, task-level duties for each role mentioned (e.g., Compliance Officer: quarterly policy approval; IT Security: daily log review) using **Action Verb + Frequency** format.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - Use numbered subheadings per requirement: 
     - "1. REQUIREMENT:"
     - "2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:"
     - "3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:"
   - For machine attestation, describe practical, automatable methods for collecting evidence (e.g., "Use API integrations to validate dual authorization logs").
   - For human attestation, specify the exact actions, artifacts, and how they will be ingested into Surveilr (e.g., "The IT manager must sign off on the dual authorization report, which is then uploaded to Surveilr").

6. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation directly tied to the **KPIs/SLAs** defined in the Evidence Collection Methods.

7. **Exceptions**: Outline any exceptions to the policy, including the process for requesting and approving exceptions.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Detail **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs (e.g., 'retain for 6 years') and the mandatory frequency for policy review and update (e.g., 'reviewed at least annually').

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

Ensure that the policy maximizes machine attestability and includes attestation guidance in every section. Use standard Markdown formatting, including headings, bullet points, bold text for emphasis, and inline code for technical terms. Do not include References subsections within individual policy sections; the References section should only appear at the very end of the document. 

The policy text must explicitly use and **BOLD** the enforced keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**. 

End the policy document with exactly ONE References section.
