# Network Architecture Diagrams Policy

## Introduction
This policy outlines the requirements for maintaining network architecture diagrams that ensure the security and integrity of the organization's network environment. It is critical for assessing the security posture of the network and documenting sensitive data flows, thereby supporting compliance with the CMMC control TBD - 3.11.4e.

## Policy Statement
The organization shall maintain comprehensive network architecture diagrams that:
- Contain sufficient detail to assess the security of the network's architecture.
- Reflect the current architecture of the network environment.
- Document all sensitive and regulated data flows.

## Scope
This policy applies to all organizational entities and environments, including:
- Cloud-hosted systems
- SaaS applications
- Third-party vendor systems (Business Associates)
- All channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit sensitive data.

## Responsibilities
- **IT Security Team**: 
  - **Create and update** network architecture diagrams **quarterly**.
  - **Review** diagrams for accuracy and completeness **monthly**.
- **Network Administrators**: 
  - **Maintain** the integrity of network architecture diagrams **continuously**.
  - **Document** any changes to the network architecture **immediately**.
- **Compliance Officer**: 
  - **Oversee** the attestation process and ensure compliance with this policy **annually**.
  - **Facilitate** the **Annual Review** of the policy and related documentation.

## Evidence Collection Methods

1. **REQUIREMENT**: Maintain detailed network architecture diagrams.
   - **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Use OSquery to collect and validate network architecture diagrams daily.
   - **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: The IT Security Team must sign off on the quarterly review of network architecture diagrams.

2. **REQUIREMENT**: Ensure diagrams reflect the current architecture.
   - **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Automate version control tracking for network architecture diagrams using Git.
   - **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: The Network Administrators must conduct a monthly review and document any discrepancies.

3. **REQUIREMENT**: Document all sensitive/regulated data flows.
   - **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Utilize data flow mapping tools to automatically generate reports on data flows.
   - **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: The Compliance Officer must validate and approve data flow documentation **quarterly**.

## Verification Criteria
- Compliance will be validated through:
  - Successful completion of **quarterly** reviews of network architecture diagrams.
  - Evidence of **monthly** updates and reviews documented in the compliance logs.
  - Confirmation of data flow documentation accuracy during the **Annual Review**.

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the Compliance Officer. Exceptions will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis and must include a justification for non-compliance.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: All evidence and logs related to network architecture diagrams must be retained for a minimum of **three years**.
- **Mandatory Frequency for Policy Review and Update**: This policy must be reviewed and updated **annually** to ensure continued relevance and compliance.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding and compliance with this policy through a formal attestation process. Comprehensive audit logs will be maintained for all critical actions related to network architecture diagrams.
