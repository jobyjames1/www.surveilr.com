You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "TBD - 3.14.1e" (FII: "FII-SCF-AST-0018"). 

The policy document must follow this exact structure: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References.** Each section should be clearly defined using H2 headings (##) and must not include References subsections within the policy sections. The References section should appear only at the very end of the document.

1. **Introduction**: Provide an overview of the policy's purpose and importance regarding the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of product supplier keys and data.

2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly articulate the organization's commitment to protecting product supplier keys and data.

3. **Scope**: Explicitly define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments, such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

4. **Responsibilities**: Define specific, task-level duties (using **Action Verb + Frequency**) for each role involved in the policy, such as Compliance Officer, IT Security, and any other relevant personnel. 

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - Use numbered subheadings for each requirement: 
     - "1. REQUIREMENT:"
     - "2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:"
     - "3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:"
   - For each requirement, describe practical, automatable methods for machine attestation and precise steps for human attestation, including how artifacts will be documented and ingested into Surveilr.

6. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the **SMART** instructions and **KPIs/SLAs** defined in the Evidence Collection Methods.

7. **Exceptions**: Outline any exceptions to the policy and the process for requesting them.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Detail the minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs (e.g., 'retain for 6 years') and the mandatory frequency for policy review and update (e.g., 'reviewed at least annually').

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

10. **References**: This section should be the final section of the policy document and contain all external references in the format [Link Text](URL). If no external references exist, state "None."

Ensure that the policy maximizes machine attestability, includes specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) instructions, and emphasizes the importance of attestation methods. The policy must also include the enforced keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review** in bold text. 

Remember, do not include any SQL queries, code blocks, or references subsections within individual policy sections. The final document must end with exactly ONE References section.
