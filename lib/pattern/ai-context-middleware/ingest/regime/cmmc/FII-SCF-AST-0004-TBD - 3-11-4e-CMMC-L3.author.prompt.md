You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control : TBD - 3.11.4e (FII: FII-SCF-AST-0004). 

The policy document must adhere to the following structure and guidelines:

1. **Document Structure**: The policy **MUST** include the following sections in this exact order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References**. Ensure that **References subsections do NOT appear within individual policy sections**.

2. **Policy Content**:
   - Each section should clearly explain the control requirement.
   - Include **MACHINE ATTESTATION** methods that are practical and automatable (e.g., "Use OSquery to collect network architecture diagrams daily").
   - Specify **HUMAN ATTESTATION** methods where automation is impractical (e.g., "The IT manager must sign off on the quarterly review of network architecture diagrams").

3. **Operational Detail and Specificity**: Replace general statements with **Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART)** instructions. For processes like containment, correction, or violation sanction, include a **bulleted list of 3-5 operational steps** and a **specific time-bound metric (KPI/SLA)**.

4. **Scope Definition**: Explicitly define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments, covering **cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems (Business Associates)**, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit sensitive data.

5. **Attestation Guidance**: For each requirement, provide concrete examples of automated evidence collection/validation and define the exact action, artifact, and ingestion method into Surveilr for human attestation.

6. **Responsibilities Section**: Define specific, task-level duties (action verbs and frequency) for each role mentioned, and explicitly link to or reference related organizational plans for escalation and recovery/disciplinary action.

7. **Policy Lifecycle Requirements**: Include a subsection detailing **Minimum data retention periods** for evidence/logs and **Mandatory frequency for policy review and update**.

8. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require **Workforce member acknowledgement/attestation** of understanding and compliance, and comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions.

9. **Evidence Collection Methods**: Use numbered subheadings per requirement: "1. REQUIREMENT:", "2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:", "3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:".

10. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the **KPIs/SLAs** defined in the operational detail.

11. **Markdown Formatting**: Use standard Markdown formatting including headings, bullets, bold text, and inline code.

12. **Hyperlinks**: Use [Link Text](URL) format for external references.

13. **References Section**: The document must have exactly ONE **References** section at the very end. 

14. **Keyword Emphasis**: The policy text **MUST** explicitly use and **BOLD** the enforced keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**.

15. **Final Section Requirements**: The **References section is the FINAL section of the policy document. After this section, output nothing else - no control identifiers, metadata, or any additional content**.
