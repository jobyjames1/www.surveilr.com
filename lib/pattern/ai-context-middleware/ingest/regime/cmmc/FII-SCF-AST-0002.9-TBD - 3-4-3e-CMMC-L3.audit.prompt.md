You're an **official auditor (e.g., CMMC Auditor)**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

  * **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
  * **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
      * **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
      * **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
      * **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
  * **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
      * **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
      * **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
      * **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
  * **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

  * **Audit Standard/Framework:** CMMC
  * **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "The organization implements and manages a Configuration Management Database (CMDB) to monitor and govern technology asset-specific information."
Control Code: TBD - 3.4.3e,
Control Question: Does the organization implement and manage a Configuration Management Database (CMDB), or similar technology, to monitor and govern technology asset-specific information?
Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII): FII-SCF-AST-0002.9
  * **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
    "This policy outlines the organization's commitment to effective asset management and configuration management through the implementation and management of a Configuration Management Database (CMDB). The purpose of this policy is to ensure that all technology asset-specific information is accurately monitored and governed, thereby enhancing the organization's ability to manage risks associated with technology assets and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements."
  * **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "Evidence includes OSquery results showing asset inventories, API call logs validating access controls, and signed reports from personnel confirming the accuracy of the CMDB entries."

**Requirements for Your Audit Report (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: CMMC - TBD - 3.4.3e

**Overall Audit Result: [PASS/FAIL]**
**Date of Audit:** [Current Date, e.g., 2025-07-28]
**Auditor Role:** [Your designated auditor role, e.g., CMMC Auditor]
**Control Code:** TBD - 3.4.3e
**Control Question:** Does the organization implement and manage a Configuration Management Database (CMDB), or similar technology, to monitor and govern technology asset-specific information?
**Internal ID (FII):** FII-SCF-AST-0002.9
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** The organization implements and manages a Configuration Management Database (CMDB) to monitor and govern technology asset-specific information.

## 1. Executive Summary

[Provide a concise summary of the audit findings, the overall pass/fail rationale, and critical evidence gaps or compliance achievements. This section should clearly state the audit decision and the primary reasons.]

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

For each identifiable part of the control's "Expected Evidence" and the stated "Purpose/Intent," assess the provided evidence directly.

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** The organization must maintain a CMDB to ensure accurate tracking of all technology assets and their configurations.
    * **Provided Evidence:** OSquery results showing asset inventories.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** OSquery was used to collect asset inventories.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM asset_inventory WHERE acquisition_date >= '2025-01-01';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The OSquery results demonstrate that the organization has maintained an accurate inventory of technology assets, fulfilling the requirement.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Implementation of API integrations to validate access controls automatically.
    * **Provided Evidence:** API call logs validating access controls.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** API calls were made to validate access controls.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM access_control_logs WHERE timestamp >= '2025-01-01';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The API call logs confirm that access controls are being validated automatically, meeting the control's requirements.

### 2.2 Human Attestation Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Collection of signed reports and certification logs from personnel.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Signed reports confirming the accuracy of the CMDB entries.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** Personnel signed reports certifying the CMDB entries.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** Surveilr recorded the signed reports as evidence of human attestation.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The signed reports provide valid human attestation confirming the accuracy of the CMDB, fulfilling the requirement.

## 3. Overall Alignment with Control's Intent Spirit

* **Assessment:** The provided evidence demonstrates that the control's underlying purpose and intent are being met in practice.
* **Justification:** The evidence shows that the organization effectively monitors and governs technology asset-specific information through both machine and human attestation methods.
* **Critical Gaps in Spirit (if applicable):** None identified.

## 4. Audit Conclusion and Final Justification

* **Final Decision:** PASS
* **Comprehensive Rationale:** The evidence provided meets all the requirements of the control, demonstrating compliance with both the literal and intended spirit of the control.

## 5. Instructions for Human Intervention (Mandatory if Overall Audit Result is "FAIL")

**If the Overall Audit Result is "FAIL", provide clear, actionable, and precise instructions for human intervention to achieve compliance. This section is an auditor's directive.**

* **Specific Missing Evidence Required:**
    * [For each missing piece of evidence identified in Section 2, state *exactly* what is needed.]
    * [Specify the required format/type for each missing piece.]
* **Specific Non-Compliant Evidence Required Correction:**
    * [For each instance of non-compliant evidence identified in Section 2, clearly state *why* it is non-compliant and what *specific correction* is required.]
    * [Specify the action needed.]
* **Required Human Action Steps:**
    * [List precise steps a human auditor or compliance officer needs to take.]
    * [Specify which teams or individuals are responsible for producing or correcting the evidence.]
* **Next Steps for Re-Audit:** [Outline the process for re-submission of the corrected/missing evidence for re-evaluation.]
