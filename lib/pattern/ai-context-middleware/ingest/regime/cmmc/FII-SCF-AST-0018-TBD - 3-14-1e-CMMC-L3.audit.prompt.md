You're an **official auditor (e.g., auditor)**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

  * **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
  * **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
      * **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
      * **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
      * **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
  * **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
      * **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
      * **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
      * **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
  * **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

  * **Audit Standard/Framework:** CMMC
  * **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "To ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of product supplier keys and data, which serve as critical 'roots of trust' for integrity verification."
Control Code: 3.14.1e,
Control Question: Does the organization provision and protect the confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of product supplier keys and data that can be used as a “roots of trust” basis for integrity verification?
Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII): FII-SCF-AST-0018
  * **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
    "The purpose of this policy is to establish a framework for the protection of product supplier keys and data, ensuring their confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity. These elements serve as critical 'roots of trust' for integrity verification within our organization. By implementing robust measures to safeguard these assets, we aim to mitigate risks associated with unauthorized access, data breaches, and potential misuse, thereby enhancing our overall security posture and compliance with regulatory requirements."
  * **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "Automated logging of access and modifications to product supplier keys and data using secure logging mechanisms; attendance records from quarterly training sessions on safeguarding product supplier keys and data; automated tools verifying the integrity of product supplier keys and data through cryptographic checksums; monthly reports from IT Security on the status of machine attestations; signed acknowledgments from employees regarding their understanding of the policy."

**Requirements for Your Audit Report (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: CMMC - 3.14.1e

**Overall Audit Result: [PASS/FAIL]**
**Date of Audit:** [Current Date, e.g., 2025-07-28]
**Auditor Role:** [Your designated auditor role, e.g., CMMC Auditor]
**Control Code:** 3.14.1e
**Control Question:** Does the organization provision and protect the confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of product supplier keys and data that can be used as a “roots of trust” basis for integrity verification?
**Internal ID (FII):** FII-SCF-AST-0018
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** To ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of product supplier keys and data, which serve as critical 'roots of trust' for integrity verification.

## 1. Executive Summary

[Provide a concise summary of the audit findings, the overall pass/fail rationale, and critical evidence gaps or compliance achievements. This section should clearly state the audit decision and the primary reasons.]

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

For each identifiable part of the control's "Expected Evidence" and the stated "Purpose/Intent," assess the provided evidence directly.

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Automated logging of access and modifications to product supplier keys and data.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Evidence of automated logging mechanisms in place.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Automated data ingestion through secure logging mechanisms.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SQL query to verify logs for access and modifications.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The evidence demonstrates that automated logging is implemented and functioning as required.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Cryptographic checksums for integrity verification.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Automated tools verifying integrity through cryptographic checksums.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Automated integrity checks scheduled weekly.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SQL query to check the results of integrity verification.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The evidence shows that integrity checks are performed regularly and meet the control requirements.

### 2.2 Human Attestation Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Attendance records from quarterly training sessions.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Documented attendance records submitted to the Compliance Officer.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** Employees attending training sessions.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** Records stored in Surveilr for compliance verification.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** Attendance records confirm that employees are trained on safeguarding product supplier keys and data.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Signed acknowledgments of policy understanding.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Signed acknowledgment forms from employees.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** Employees signing acknowledgment forms.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** Signed documents stored in Surveilr.
