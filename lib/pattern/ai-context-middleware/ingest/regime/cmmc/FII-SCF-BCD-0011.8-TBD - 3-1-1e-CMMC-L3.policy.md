# Dual Authorization Policy for Deletion or Destruction of Sensitive Backup Media and Data

## Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to establish a framework for implementing dual authorization for the deletion or destruction of sensitive backup media and data. This policy is crucial for safeguarding sensitive information and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. By enforcing dual authorization, the organization mitigates the risk of unauthorized access and accidental data loss, thereby enhancing the integrity and security of sensitive data.

## Policy Statement
The organization is committed to implementing and enforcing **dual authorization** for all actions related to the deletion or destruction of sensitive backup media and data. This policy mandates that no single individual shall have the authority to delete or destroy sensitive data without the explicit consent of a second authorized individual, thereby promoting accountability and security.

## Scope
This policy applies to all entities and environments within the organization, including but not limited to:
- Cloud-hosted systems
- SaaS applications
- Third-party vendor systems
- All channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit sensitive data

## Responsibilities
- **Compliance Officer:** Review and approve the policy **quarterly**.
- **IT Security:** Review daily logs for dual authorization compliance **daily**.
- **Data Owners:** Ensure that all deletion requests are accompanied by dual authorization **at the time of request**.
- **System Administrators:** Implement technical controls to enforce dual authorization **upon system configuration**.

## Evidence Collection Methods

### 1. REQUIREMENT:
- Collect logs of dual authorization actions via system-generated reports that document both authorizations.

### 2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:
- Use API integrations to validate dual authorization logs automatically. This includes:
  - Automated scripts that query the system for authorization records.
  - Scheduled tasks that generate compliance reports on dual authorization activities.

### 3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:
- The IT manager must sign off on the dual authorization report, which is then uploaded to Surveilr. This includes:
  - Manual verification of logs by the IT manager.
  - Documentation of the sign-off process, including timestamps and user IDs.

## Verification Criteria
Compliance with this policy will be validated through the following **KPIs/SLAs**:
- 100% of deletion requests must have dual authorization logged.
- Daily log reviews must show no instances of non-compliance.
- Monthly reports must indicate that all dual authorization actions are documented and signed off.

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be formally requested in writing and approved by the Compliance Officer. The request must include:
- Justification for the exception.
- Duration for which the exception is requested.
- Any compensating controls that will be implemented during the exception period.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention:** All evidence and logs related to dual authorization must be retained for a minimum of **6 years**.
- The policy must undergo an **Annual Review** to ensure its effectiveness and relevance to current practices and regulations.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding and compliance with this policy through formal attestation. Comprehensive audit logging must be maintained for all critical actions related to dual authorization, and formal documentation must be kept for all exceptions granted under this policy.
