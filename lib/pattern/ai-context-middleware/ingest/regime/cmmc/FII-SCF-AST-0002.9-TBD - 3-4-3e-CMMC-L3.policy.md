# Configuration Management Database (CMDB) Policy

## 1. Introduction
This policy outlines the organization's commitment to effective asset management and configuration management through the implementation and management of a Configuration Management Database (CMDB). The purpose of this policy is to ensure that all technology asset-specific information is accurately monitored and governed, thereby enhancing the organization's ability to manage risks associated with technology assets and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.

## 2. Policy Statement
The organization is committed to implementing and managing a Configuration Management Database (CMDB) or similar technology to monitor and govern technology asset-specific information. This commitment includes maintaining accurate records of all assets, their configurations, and their relationships to ensure effective management and compliance.

## 3. Scope
This policy applies to all technology assets within the organization, including but not limited to:
- Cloud-hosted systems
- Software as a Service (SaaS) applications
- Third-party vendor systems
- All channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI)

## 4. Responsibilities
- **Compliance Officer**: **Review** the CMDB for compliance with regulatory standards **quarterly**.
- **IT Security**: **Monitor** access controls and asset configurations **monthly**.
- **Asset Management Personnel**: **Update** asset records in the CMDB **immediately** upon acquisition or disposal of assets.

## 5. Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT**: The organization must maintain a CMDB to ensure accurate tracking of all technology assets and their configurations.
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Utilize OSquery to collect asset inventories and implement API integrations to validate access controls automatically.
3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Collect signed reports and certification logs from personnel, which will be ingested into Surveilr for human attestation.

## 6. Verification Criteria
Compliance will be validated through the following **SMART** objectives and **KPIs/SLAs**:
- **Objective**: Ensure 100% of technology assets are recorded in the CMDB within 24 hours of acquisition.
- **KPI**: Monthly audits will confirm that 95% of assets have accurate configuration data.
- **SLA**: Any discrepancies in asset records must be resolved within 48 hours of identification.

## 7. Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the Compliance Officer. Documentation must include the rationale for the exception and the expected duration.

## 8. Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: Evidence and logs must be retained for a minimum of **6 years**.
- **Annual Review**: This policy must be reviewed and updated at least **annually** to ensure continued relevance and compliance.

## 9. Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge and attest to their understanding and compliance with this policy. Comprehensive audit logging will be maintained for all critical actions related to the CMDB, and formal documentation must be created for all exceptions.
