You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "TBD - 3.5.3e" (FII: FII-SCF-AST-0002.5). 

The policy document must follow this structure: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References.** Each section should be clearly defined with H2 headings (##) and should include the following:

1. **Introduction**: Briefly introduce the purpose of the policy and its importance in ensuring compliance with CMMC requirements.

2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly articulate the organization's stance on using automated mechanisms for Network Access Control (NAC) to detect unauthorized devices and manage network access.

3. **Scope**: Define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments, such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems.

4. **Responsibilities**: Specify task-level duties for each role involved in the policy implementation, using **Action Verb + Frequency** format (e.g., "Compliance Officer: quarterly policy approval").

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - 1. REQUIREMENT: Describe the requirement for using automated mechanisms for NAC.
   - 2. MACHINE ATTESTATION: Suggest practical, automatable methods for evidence collection, such as using OSquery to monitor network devices.
   - 3. HUMAN ATTESTATION: Define specific actions that must be taken by personnel, including documentation and ingestion methods into Surveilr.

6. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation that are directly tied to **KPIs/SLAs** defined in the Evidence Collection Methods.

7. **Exceptions**: Outline the process for documenting any exceptions to the policy, including justification and approval.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Detail the **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs and the **Annual Review** frequency for the policy.

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, and mandate comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions.

Ensure that the policy maximizes machine attestability by including specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and time-bound (**SMART**) instructions throughout. Emphasize that all sections must include attestation guidance, and avoid including References subsections within individual policy sections. The document must end with exactly ONE References section, which should be the final section of the policy document.
