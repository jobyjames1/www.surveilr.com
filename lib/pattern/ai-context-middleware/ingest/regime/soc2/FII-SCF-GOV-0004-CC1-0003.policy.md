## Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to establish a standardized approach for the documentation and attestation of job descriptions within the organization. This ensures clarity in roles and responsibilities, compliance with regulatory requirements, and facilitates effective workforce management.

## Policy Statement
All job descriptions must be documented, reviewed, and maintained in accordance with organizational standards. This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party personnel associated with the organization.

## Scope
This policy applies to all job descriptions for positions across the organization, including:
- Cloud-hosted systems
- SaaS applications
- Third-party vendor systems (Business Associates)
- All channels through which job descriptions are created, received, maintained, or transmitted

## Responsibilities
- **Human Resources Manager**: 
  - Ensure all job descriptions are updated annually.
  - Validate compliance with this policy during audits.
  
- **Compliance Officer**: 
  - Review job descriptions for compliance quarterly.
  - Document any discrepancies and escalate as per the Incident Response Plan.

- **Department Heads**: 
  - Provide updates to job descriptions as roles evolve.
  - Submit changes for approval to the Human Resources Manager within 5 business days of any role change.

## Evidence Collection Methods

### Job Description Documentation Requirement
Job descriptions must be formally documented and easily accessible.

#### Machine Attestation Approach
- Utilize a centralized HR management system to store job descriptions. Ensure that any changes are logged with timestamps for audit purposes.

#### Human Attestation (if unavoidable)
- Department Heads must submit signed documents confirming the accuracy of job descriptions quarterly. Signed documents should be uploaded to Surveilr with relevant metadata (review date, reviewer name).

### Job Description Review Requirement
Regular review of job descriptions is necessary to ensure compliance and relevance.

#### Machine Attestation Approach
- Set up automated reminders within the HR management system to notify Department Heads quarterly for job description reviews.

#### Human Attestation (if unavoidable)
- The Human Resources Manager must collect and file signed review confirmations from Department Heads annually and upload them to Surveilr.

## Verification Criteria
- All job descriptions must be documented and stored in the HR management system.
- Evidence of quarterly reviews must exist, with signed attestations from Department Heads.
- Job descriptions must be updated within 5 business days following any role change.

## Exceptions
Exceptions to this policy require formal documentation, including:
- Justification for the exception
- Duration of the exception
- Approval from the Compliance Officer

## Policy Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: All evidence and logs must be retained for a minimum of 6 years.
- **Policy Review**: This policy must be reviewed at least annually to ensure continued relevance and compliance.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding and compliance with this policy. Comprehensive audit logs must be maintained for all critical actions such as creation, modification, and termination of job descriptions. Formal documentation must be maintained for all exceptions granted.
