## Introduction

The purpose of this policy is to establish a framework for the utilization and documentation of new hire checklists to ensure a consistent and effective onboarding process for all new employees. This policy outlines the requirements for machine and human attestations, ensuring compliance with organizational onboarding standards.

## Policy Statement

All new hires must be onboarded using a standardized checklist that documents each step of the process. This checklist should be utilized across all departments, including cloud-hosted systems and third-party vendor systems.

## Scope

This policy applies to all new hires across the organization, including full-time, part-time, and contract employees, regardless of their work environment (on-premises, remote, or third-party vendors).
