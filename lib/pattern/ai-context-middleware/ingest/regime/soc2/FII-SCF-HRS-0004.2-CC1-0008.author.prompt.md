You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control : "" (FII: FII-SCF-HRS-0004.2). 

The policy document should follow this structure:

1. **Front Matter (YAML Header)**: Include the following metadata fields:
   - title
   - weight
   - description
   - publishDate
   - publishBy
   - classification
   - documentVersion
   - documentType
   - control-id (set to "")
   - control-question (set to "")
   - fiiId (set to "")
   - regimeType
   - category (as array)
   - merge-group
   - order

2. **Introduction**: Provide a concise purpose of the policy.

3. **Policy Sections**: Use H2 headings (##) for each major requirement, ensuring each section:
   - Explains the control requirement.
   - Suggests machine attestation methods (e.g., "Use OSquery to collect asset inventories daily").
   - Suggests human attestation methods where unavoidable (e.g., "Manager signs quarterly inventory validation report").

4. **Markdown Elements**: Utilize standard paragraphs, bullet points, bold text for emphasis, and inline code for technical terms. Include citation links for external references in the format: [Link Text](URL).

5. **Attestation Guidance**:
   - **Machine Attestation**: Describe practical, automatable methods with examples.
   - **Human Attestation**: Describe precise steps and artifacts, including metadata for ingestion into Surveilr.

6. **Format**: Ensure clear sections (Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, References) in markdown format.

7. **Operational Detail and Specificity (MANDATORY SMART)**: Replace general statements with Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART) instructions. Include 3-5 operational steps with a specific time-bound metric (KPI/SLA).

8. **Comprehensive Scope Definition (MANDATORY)**: Explicitly define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments, covering cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels related to ePHI.

9. **Prioritize Machine Attestation**: Provide concrete examples of automated evidence collection.

10. **Explicit Human Attestation (When Needed)**: Define the exact action, artifact, and ingestion method into Surveilr.

11. **Granular Roles and Cross-Referencing (MANDATORY)**: Define specific, task-level duties for each role, linking to related organizational plans for escalation and recovery.

12. **Policy Lifecycle Requirements (MANDATORY)**: Include minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs and mandatory frequency for policy review and update.

13. **Formal Documentation and Audit (MANDATORY)**: Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

14. **Attestation Descriptions Only**: Focus on describing methods, not embedding SQL queries.

15. **Evidence Collection Methods**: Include subheadings per requirement explaining the requirement, machine attestation approach, and human attestation (if unavoidable).

16. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear measurable criteria for compliance validation.

17. **Use standard Markdown formatting**: Include headings, bullets, bold text, and inline code.

18. **References Section**: End with a ### References section. If no external references exist, output a placeholder: ### References followed by None.

Ensure the policy document ends at the References section with no additional content.
