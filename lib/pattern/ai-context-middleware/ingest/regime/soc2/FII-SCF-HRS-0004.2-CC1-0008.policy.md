## Introduction

The purpose of this policy is to establish the requirements for Continued Professional Education (CPE) training among employees to ensure ongoing professional development and compliance with industry standards. This policy aims to maintain a competent workforce capable of meeting the organization's operational and strategic objectives.

## Policy Statement

All employees are required to participate in Continued Professional Education training to enhance their skills, knowledge, and competencies relevant to their roles. This training is essential for maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements and ensuring high standards of service delivery.

## Scope

This policy applies to all employees across all departments and levels within the organization, including remote and on-site staff. It encompasses all training related to professional development, regulatory compliance, and skills enhancement relevant to their job functions, including training provided by third-party vendors and any cloud-hosted systems utilized.

## Responsibilities

- **Human Resources Team**: Responsible for developing and maintaining the CPE training curriculum and scheduling.
- **Department Managers**: Accountable for ensuring employees complete required training annually and report attendance.
- **Employees**: Required to participate in the training and ensure compliance with this policy.

## Evidence Collection Methods

### Requirement: Annual CPE Training

- **Machine Attestation**: 
  - Implement a Learning Management System (LMS) that tracks employee progress and completion of CPE training modules automatically. Set automated reminders for upcoming training sessions.
  
- **Human Attestation**: 
  - Employees must submit a signed training completion report to their manager every year. The report should include the training title, completion date, and a brief summary of the content covered. This report will be ingested into Surveilr for compliance verification.

### Requirement: Training Content Review

- **Machine Attestation**: 
  - Use automated reporting tools to assess the relevance and effectiveness of training content based on employee feedback and performance metrics.

- **Human Attestation**: 
  - Department managers must conduct a semi-annual review of training materials and submit a signed report to the compliance team confirming the review and any necessary updates.

## Verification Criteria

- **Completion Rate**: 100% of employees must complete their required CPE training by the end of each calendar year.
- **Training Content Review**: Training materials must be reviewed at least twice a year, with documented evidence of updates or affirmations of relevance.

## Attestation Guidance

### Machine Attestation

- Utilize the LMS to automate the collection of training completion data. For example, set up the system to generate a report every month detailing which employees have completed their CPE training requirements.

### Human Attestation

- Establish a process where each employee, upon completion of training, signs a training completion report. This report must be submitted to their direct manager, who will compile and submit these reports to HR quarterly for ingestion into Surveilr.

## Policy Lifecycle Requirements

- **Data Retention**: All training records must be retained for a minimum of three years.
- **Policy Review**: This policy must be reviewed and updated at least annually to ensure alignment with regulatory changes and organizational goals.

## Formal Documentation and Audit

- All employees must acknowledge their understanding and compliance with this policy by signing a document upon onboarding and annually thereafter.
- Critical actions related to training completion and content review must be logged in the LMS, ensuring comprehensive audit trails for all compliance activities.
