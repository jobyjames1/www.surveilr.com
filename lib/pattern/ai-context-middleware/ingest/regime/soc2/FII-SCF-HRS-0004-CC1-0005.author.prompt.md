You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control : "Has management documented formal HR procedures that include the employee onboarding process?" (FII: FII-SCF-HRS-0004). The policy document must include the following elements:

1. **Document Structure**: 
   - Front Matter (YAML Header): Include required metadata fields: title, weight, description, publishDate, publishBy, classification, documentVersion, documentType, control-id (set to ""), control-question (set to ""), fiiId (set to ""), regimeType, category (as array), merge-group, and order.
   - Introduction: Concise purpose of the policy.
   - Policy Sections: Use H2 headings (##) per major requirement. Each section should:
     - Explain the control requirement.
     - Suggest machine attestation methods (e.g., "Use OSquery to collect asset inventories daily").
     - Suggest human attestation methods where unavoidable (e.g., "Manager signs quarterly inventory validation report").
   - References: End with ### References.

2. **Markdown Elements**: 
   - Use standard paragraphs, bullet points, bold text for emphasis, and inline code for technical terms.
   - Use the format for showing Citation links component for external references: [Link Text](URL).

3. **Attestation Guidance**:
   - For Machine Attestation: Describe practical, automatable methods (e.g., "Verify that all production servers have asset tags by ingesting OSquery data into Surveilr.").
   - For Human Attestation: Describe precise steps and artifacts (e.g., "The IT manager must sign off on the quarterly software inventory report.").

4. **Format**: 
   - Clear sections (Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, References) in markdown format.

5. **Operational Detail and Specificity (MANDATORY SMART)**: 
   - The policy MUST replace general statements with Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART) instructions, including a bulleted list of 3-5 operational steps and a specific time-bound metric (KPI/SLA).

6. **Comprehensive Scope Definition (MANDATORY)**: 
   - Explicitly define the policy's scope to include ALL relevant entities and environments, covering cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

7. **Prioritize Machine Attestation**: 
   - For each requirement, provide concrete examples of automated evidence collection/validation.

8. **Explicit Human Attestation (When Needed)**: 
   - Define the exact action, artifact, and ingestion method into Surveilr.

9. **Granular Roles and Cross-Referencing (MANDATORY)**: 
   - The Responsibilities section MUST define specific, task-level duties for each role mentioned and explicitly link to or reference related organizational plans.

10. **Policy Lifecycle Requirements (MANDATORY)**: 
    - The policy MUST contain a dedicated subsection detailing minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs and mandatory frequency for policy review and update.

11. **Formal Documentation and Audit (MANDATORY)**: 
    - The policy MUST require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance and comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions.

12. **Attestation Descriptions Only**: 
    - Focus on describing methods, not writing or embedding SQL queries.

13. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
    - Must include subheadings per requirement with explanations, machine attestation approaches, and human attestation if unavoidable.

14. **Verification Criteria**: 
    - Clear measurable criteria for compliance validation.

15. **Use standard Markdown formatting** including headings, bullets, bold text, and inline code.

16. **End with ### References section**. If no external references exist, output a placeholder: ### References followed by None.

Ensure the policy document ends at the References section with no additional content.
