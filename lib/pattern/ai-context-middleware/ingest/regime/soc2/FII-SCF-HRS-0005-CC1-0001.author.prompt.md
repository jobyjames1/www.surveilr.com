You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control : "" (FII: FII-SCF-HRS-0005). 

Please follow these instructions for crafting the policy document:

1. **Document Structure**:
   - **Front Matter (YAML Header)**: Include the following metadata fields: title, weight, description, publishDate, publishBy, classification, documentVersion, documentType, control-id (set to ""), control-question (set to "Are core values communicated from executive management to personnel through policies and the employee handbook?"), fiiId (set to "FII-SCF-HRS-0005"), regimeType, category (as an array), merge-group, and order.
   - **Introduction**: Provide a concise purpose of the policy.
   - **Policy Sections**: Use H2 headings (##) for major requirements.
     - Explain the control requirement.
     - Suggest machine attestation methods (e.g., "Use OSquery to collect asset inventories daily").
     - Suggest human attestation methods where unavoidable (e.g., "Manager signs quarterly inventory validation report").

2. **Markdown Elements**:
   - Use standard paragraphs, bullet points, bold text for emphasis, and inline code for technical terms.
   - Format citations as follows: [Link Text](URL).

3. **Attestation Guidance**:
   - For **Machine Attestation**: Describe practical methods (e.g., "Verify that values are communicated by ingesting training logs into Surveilr").
   - For **Human Attestation**: Describe precise steps and artifacts (e.g., "HR maintains signed training completion logs and uploads them to Surveilr with metadata").

4. **Format**: Use clear sections (Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, References) in markdown format.

5. **Operational Detail and Specificity (SMART)**: Replace general statements with Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART) instructions, and include a bulleted list of 3-5 operational steps with a specific time-bound metric (e.g., "complete training within 30 days").

6. **Comprehensive Scope Definition**: Explicitly define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments, including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems.

7. **Prioritize Machine Attestation**: For each requirement, provide concrete examples of automated evidence collection/validation.

8. **Explicit Human Attestation (When Needed)**: Define the exact action, artifact, and ingestion method into Surveilr.

9. **Granular Roles and Cross-Referencing**: Define specific, task-level duties for each role mentioned and explicitly link to related organizational plans.

10. **Policy Lifecycle Requirements**: Include minimum data retention periods for evidence and mandatory frequency for policy review and update.

11. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for exceptions.

12. **Attestation Descriptions Only**: Focus on methods, not writing or embedding SQL queries.

13. **Evidence Collection Methods**: Include subheadings per requirement with explanations, machine attestation approaches, and human attestation methods if unavoidable.

14. **Verification Criteria**: Define clear measurable criteria for compliance validation.

15. **End with the References section**: The **References section is the FINAL section of the policy document. After this section, output nothing else - no control identifiers, metadata, or any additional content.** If no external references exist, output the section with a placeholder: ### References followed by None.

Please ensure the generated policy document ends with the References section and contains no additional content.
