## Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to establish a structured mentor program aimed at developing personnel skills and enhancing professional growth within the organization. This program is designed to foster a supportive learning environment and ensure that employees receive guidance and development opportunities.

## Scope
This policy applies to all employees within the organization, including full-time, part-time, and contract personnel across all departments and locations, including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems.

## Responsibilities
- **HR Manager**: 
  - Develop and manage the mentor program annually.
  - Ensure mentor-mentee pairings are established quarterly.
  
- **Mentors**: 
  - Conduct at least one mentoring session per month with their mentees.
  - Provide feedback on the menteeâ€™s progress bi-monthly.
  
- **Mentees**: 
  - Engage in monthly sessions and complete feedback surveys after each session.
  
- **Compliance Officer**: 
  - Review and approve the mentor program policy annually.

## Evidence Collection Methods

### Requirement: Establishment of a Mentorship Program
**Machine Attestation Approach**:
- Utilize a Learning Management System (LMS) to track mentor-mentee assignments and session attendance automatically. Data should be ingested into Surveilr daily for compliance verification.

**Human Attestation**:
- Mentees must complete a quarterly feedback form about their mentorship experience, which is signed and submitted to the HR Manager. The signed feedback form is uploaded to Surveilr for record-keeping.

### Requirement: Documentation of Mentorship Sessions
**Machine Attestation Approach**:
- Monitor and collect logs of mentorship sessions recorded in the LMS, ensuring that all sessions are documented with timestamps.

**Human Attestation**:
- Mentors are required to maintain a session log detailing discussion points and outcomes, signed off and submitted to HR at the end of each quarter. These logs are uploaded to Surveilr.

### Requirement: Evaluation of Program Effectiveness
**Machine Attestation Approach**:
- Analyze performance metrics from employee evaluations pre- and post-mentorship, using automated reports generated monthly.

**Human Attestation**:
- Annual review of the mentorship program effectiveness by compiling feedback from mentors and mentees into a report, which must be signed by the HR Manager and submitted to Surveilr.

## Verification Criteria
- Successful establishment and operation of the mentorship program, verified through machine attestations in the LMS and Surveilr.
- Completion of feedback forms by mentees at least quarterly.
- Signed reports and session logs must be retained and accessible for audit.

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented with justification, duration, and approval from the Compliance Officer. These exceptions will be logged in Surveilr.

## Policy Lifecycle Requirements
- All records related to mentorship sessions and feedback forms must be retained for a minimum of 6 years.
- This policy must be reviewed and updated at least annually to ensure continued relevance and effectiveness.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge and attest to their understanding and compliance with this policy. Comprehensive audit logging will be maintained for all critical actions related to the mentor program, including creation, modification, and termination of mentor-mentee relationships.
