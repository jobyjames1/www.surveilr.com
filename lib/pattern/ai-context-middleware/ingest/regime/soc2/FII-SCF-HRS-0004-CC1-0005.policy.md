## Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to ensure that management has documented formal Human Resources (HR) procedures that include a comprehensive employee onboarding process. This policy aims to establish a standardized approach that ensures compliance, efficiency, and clarity in onboarding new employees.

## Policy Statement
Management must maintain formal documentation of HR procedures that encompass the employee onboarding process. This documentation should be accessible, regularly updated, and compliant with applicable laws and regulations.

## Scope
This policy applies to all employees involved in the onboarding process across all departments, including but not limited to:
- Cloud-hosted systems
- SaaS applications
- Third-party vendor systems
- All channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI)

## Responsibilities
- **HR Manager**: Oversee the documentation of onboarding procedures and ensure adherence to this policy.
- **Department Managers**: Collaborate with HR to implement onboarding processes in their respective departments.
- **Compliance Officer**: Monitor the effectiveness of the onboarding documentation and ensure compliance with applicable regulations.

## Evidence Collection Methods

### Machine Attestation Methods
- **Automated Document Management**: Utilize a document management system to automatically track revisions and access to the onboarding documentation. Regularly verify that the latest version is available and has been reviewed.
- **Scheduled Audits**: Implement a quarterly audit using automated tools to ensure that onboarding procedures are followed and documented. This can include checks against employee records.

### Human Attestation Methods
- **Employee Acknowledgment**: Each new employee must sign an acknowledgment form indicating they have reviewed the onboarding materials. This form must be securely stored and must be verified by the HR team.
- **Manager Sign-off**: Department managers must sign off on the onboarding completion checklist for each new hire, which will then be stored in the employee's personnel file.

## Verification Criteria
- Formal HR procedures must be documented and reviewed biannually.
- Evidence of onboarding completion must be available for all new hires within 30 days of their start date.
- At least 95% of new hires must complete the onboarding process as per documented procedures.

## Policy Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: All onboarding documentation must be retained for a minimum of 5 years from the employee's termination date.
- **Policy Review Frequency**: This policy must be reviewed and updated at least annually or whenever there is a significant change in HR procedures or applicable laws.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge understanding and compliance with this policy. Comprehensive audit logs must be maintained for all critical actions related to the onboarding process, including document revisions, employee acknowledgments, and manager sign-offs.
