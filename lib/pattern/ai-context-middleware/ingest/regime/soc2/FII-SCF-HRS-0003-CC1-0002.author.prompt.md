You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control : "" (FII: FII-SCF-HRS-0003). 

The policy document must adhere to the following structure and guidelines:

1. **Document Structure**:
   - **Front Matter (YAML Header)**: Include required metadata fields: title, weight, description, publishDate, publishBy, classification, documentVersion, documentType, control-id (set to ""), control-question (set to "Is management's organizational structure with relevant reporting lines documented in an organization chart?"), fiiId (set to "FII-SCF-HRS-0003"), regimeType, category (as an array), merge-group, and order.
   - **Introduction**: Provide a concise purpose of the policy.
   - **Policy Sections**: Use H2 headings (##) for each major requirement. Each section should:
     - Explain the control requirement.
     - Suggest machine attestation methods (e.g., "Use OSquery to collect asset inventories daily").
     - Suggest human attestation methods where unavoidable (e.g., "Manager signs quarterly inventory validation report").
   - **References**: End with ### References.

2. **Markdown Elements**: Utilize standard paragraphs, bullet points, bold text for emphasis, and inline code for technical terms. Use the format [Link Text](URL) for external references.

3. **Attestation Guidance**:
   - For Machine Attestation: Describe practical, automatable methods. Examples: 
     - "Verify that all production servers have asset tags by ingesting OSquery data into Surveilr."
     - "Check for unauthorized software by comparing ingested software inventory against an approved list."
   - For Human Attestation: Describe precise steps and artifacts. Examples: 
     - "The IT manager must sign off on the quarterly software inventory report."
     - "Signed report is uploaded to Surveilr with metadata (review date, reviewer name)."

4. **Format**: Clear sections (Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, References) in markdown format.

5. **Operational Detail and Specificity (MANDATORY SMART)**: The policy **MUST** include specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) instructions. For processes like containment, correction, or prevention, include a bulleted list of 3-5 operational steps and a specific time-bound metric (KPI/SLA).

6. **Comprehensive Scope Definition (MANDATORY)**: Explicitly define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments, covering cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

7. **Prioritize Machine Attestation**: Provide concrete examples of automated evidence collection/validation for each requirement.

8. **Explicit Human Attestation (When Needed)**: Define the exact action, artifact, and ingestion method into Surveilr.

9. **Granular Roles and Cross-Referencing (MANDATORY)**: The Responsibilities section **MUST** define specific task-level duties for each role mentioned and link to related organizational plans for escalation and recovery.

10. **Policy Lifecycle Requirements (MANDATORY)**: Include minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs and mandatory frequency for policy review and update.

11. **Formal Documentation and Audit (MANDATORY)**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

12. **Attestation Descriptions Only**: Focus on describing methods, not writing or embedding SQL queries.

13. **Evidence Collection Methods**: Include subheadings per requirement with an explanation of the requirement, machine attestation approach, and human attestation (if unavoidable).

14. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear measurable criteria for compliance validation.

15. **Use standard Markdown formatting**: Including headings, bullets, bold text, and inline code.

16. **End with ### References section**.

Ensure to conclude the policy document at the References section with no additional content.
