## Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to ensure that core values are effectively communicated from executive management to personnel through well-defined policies and the employee handbook. This communication is essential for fostering a cohesive organizational culture and aligning employee behavior with the organization's values.

## Policy Statement
It is the policy of the organization that core values will be communicated clearly and consistently to all personnel through the employee handbook and relevant policies. This will ensure that all employees understand and embody these values in their daily work.

## Scope
This policy applies to all employees across the organization, including those in cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems. It encompasses all departments and roles to ensure comprehensive communication of core values.

  - Implement tools to monitor employee access to the training materials related to core values.
  
- **Human Attestation** (When Necessary):
  - HR will maintain signed acknowledgment forms from employees confirming their understanding of the core values as communicated through the employee handbook. These forms will be uploaded to Surveilr with appropriate metadata.
