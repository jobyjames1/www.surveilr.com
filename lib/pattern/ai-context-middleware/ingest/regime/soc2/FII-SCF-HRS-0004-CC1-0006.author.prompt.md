You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "Are new hire checklists utilized and activities documented to help facilitate new hire procedures?" (FII: FII-SCF-HRS-0004). 

Your policy document should follow this structure:

1. **Front Matter (YAML Header):** Include required metadata fields: title, weight, description, publishDate, publishBy, classification, documentVersion, documentType, control-id (set to ""), control-question (set to ""), fiiId (set to "FII-SCF-HRS-0004"), regimeType, category (as array), merge-group, and order.

2. **Introduction:** Provide a concise purpose of the policy.

3. **Policy Sections:** Use H2 headings (##) for each major requirement. Each section should:
   - Explain the control requirement.
   - Suggest machine attestation methods (e.g., "Use API integrations to track completion of new hire checklist activities").
   - Suggest human attestation methods where unavoidable (e.g., "HR must maintain signed documentation of checklist completion").

4. **Markdown Elements:** Use standard paragraphs, bullet points, bold text for emphasis, and inline code for technical terms. Use the format for showing Citation links for external references: [Link Text](URL).

5. **Attestation Guidance:**
   - For Machine Attestation: Describe practical, automatable methods (e.g., "Automatically log completion of each checklist item in Surveilr").
   - For Human Attestation: Describe precise steps and artifacts (e.g., "HR retains signed new hire checklist in Surveilr with metadata").

6. **Format:** Include clear sections (Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, References) in markdown format.

7. **Operational Detail and Specificity (MANDATORY SMART):** The policy MUST replace general statements with Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART) instructions. Include a bulleted list of 3-5 operational steps and a specific time-bound metric (KPI/SLA).

8. **Comprehensive Scope Definition (MANDATORY):** Explicitly define the policy's scope to include ALL relevant entities and environments, including cloud-hosted systems and third-party vendor systems.

9. **Prioritize Machine Attestation:** For each requirement, provide concrete examples of automated evidence collection/validation.

10. **Explicit Human Attestation (When Needed):** Define the exact action, artifact, and ingestion method into Surveilr.

11. **Granular Roles and Cross-Referencing (MANDATORY):** Define specific, task-level duties for each role mentioned and explicitly link to related organizational plans.

12. **Policy Lifecycle Requirements (MANDATORY):** Include minimum data retention periods and mandatory frequency for policy review and update.

13. **Formal Documentation and Audit (MANDATORY):** Require workforce member acknowledgement/attestation and comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions.

14. **Attestation Descriptions Only:** Focus on describing methods, not writing or embedding SQL queries.

15. **Evidence Collection Methods:** Include subheadings per requirement with an explanation of the requirement, machine attestation approach, and human attestation if unavoidable.

16. **Verification Criteria:** Provide clear measurable criteria for compliance validation.

17. **Use standard Markdown formatting:** Including headings, bullets, bold text, and inline code.

18. **Use [Link Text](URL) format for external references.**

19. **End with** ### References **section. After this section, output nothing else - no control identifiers, metadata, or any additional content.** 

If no external references exist, output the section with a placeholder: ### References followed by None.
