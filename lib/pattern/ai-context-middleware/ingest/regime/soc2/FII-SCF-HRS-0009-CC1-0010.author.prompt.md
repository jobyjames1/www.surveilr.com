1. **Document Structure**: 
   - Front Matter (YAML Header): Include required metadata fields: title, weight, description, publishDate, publishBy, classification, documentVersion, documentType, control-id (set to ""), control-question (set to "Has management documented formal HR procedures that include employee terminations?"), fiiId (set to "FII-SCF-HRS-0009"), regimeType, category (as array), merge-group, and order. 
   - Introduction: Concise purpose of the policy.
   - Policy Sections: Use H2 headings (##) per major requirement, explaining the control requirement, suggesting machine attestation methods, and suggesting human attestation methods where unavoidable.
   - References: End with ### References.

2. **Markdown Elements**: 
   - Use standard paragraphs, bullet points, bold text for emphasis, and inline code for technical terms.
   - Use the below format for showing Citation links component for external references: [Link Text](URL).

3. **Attestation Guidance**:
