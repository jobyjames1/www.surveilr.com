You're an **official auditor (e.g., auditor)**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

  * **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
  * **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
      * **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
      * **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
      * **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
  * **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
      * **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
      * **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
      * **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
  * **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

  * **Audit Standard/Framework:** [****]
  * **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "[Management is committed to documenting and implementing formal HR procedures that govern employee terminations. These procedures are designed to ensure that all terminations are conducted in a lawful, respectful, and consistent manner.]"
  * **Control Code:** CC1-0010
  * **Control Question:** Has management documented formal HR procedures that include employee terminations?
  * **Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII):** FII-SCF-HRS-0009
  * **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
    "[The purpose of this policy is to establish formal Human Resources (HR) procedures for employee terminations. This policy ensures compliance with legal requirements and promotes a fair and consistent process for all terminations. The policy applies to all employees of the organization, including full-time, part-time, temporary, and contract workers across all departments and locations.]"
  * **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "[Evidence of termination documentation stored in Surveilr, signed termination acknowledgment forms uploaded for each termination, completion of training modules tracked in the LMS, signed acknowledgment forms from managers, and audit logs reflecting termination actions.]"

**Requirements for Your Audit Report (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: [Audit Standard/Framework] - CC1-0010

**Overall Audit Result: [PASS/FAIL]**
**Date of Audit:** [Current Date, e.g., 2025-07-28]
**Auditor Role:** [Your designated auditor role, e.g., HR Auditor]
**Control Code:** CC1-0010
**Control Question:** Has management documented formal HR procedures that include employee terminations?
**Internal ID (FII):** FII-SCF-HRS-0009
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** Management is committed to documenting and implementing formal HR procedures that govern employee terminations. These procedures are designed to ensure that all terminations are conducted in a lawful, respectful, and consistent manner.

## 1. Executive Summary

[Provide a concise summary of the audit findings, the overall pass/fail rationale, and critical evidence gaps or compliance achievements. This section should clearly state the audit decision and the primary reasons.]

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

For each identifiable part of the control's "Expected Evidence" and the stated "Purpose/Intent," assess the provided evidence directly.

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Evidence of all HR documentation related to employee terminations stored in Surveilr.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Evidence of termination documentation stored in Surveilr.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Automated data ingestion through Surveilr.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM termination_documents WHERE stored = 'true';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The evidence confirms that all required documentation is stored and accessible in Surveilr.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Monitoring completion of training modules related to termination procedures.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Training completion evidenced by LMS data integrated with Surveilr.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Monitoring through API calls to LMS.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM training_records WHERE module = 'termination_procedures' AND status = 'completed';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** Evidence shows all relevant personnel have completed training on termination procedures.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Audit logs reflecting all termination actions taken within the specified retention period.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Audit logs reflecting termination actions.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Utilization of Surveilr's audit logging feature.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM audit_logs WHERE action = 'termination' AND date >= '2025-01-01';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** Logs are complete and reflect all actions taken in accordance with policy.

### 2.2 Human Attestation Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Signed termination acknowledgment forms uploaded for each termination.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Signed acknowledgment forms uploaded to Surveilr.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** HR must maintain a signed termination acknowledgment form.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** Forms stored in Surveilr after each termination.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** All required forms are present, demonstrating compliance with HR policies.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Managers' signed acknowledgment of understanding termination procedures.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Signed acknowledgment forms from managers.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** Managers are required to sign acknowledgment forms.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** Acknowledgment forms stored in Surveilr.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** Documentation shows compliance with the requirement for manager attestation.

## 3. Overall Alignment with Control's Intent  Spirit

* **Assessment:** The provided evidence demonstrates adherence to the control's underlying purpose and intent.
* **Justification:** The evidence collectively supports that HR procedures for employee terminations are documented, consistently followed, and compliant with legal requirements.
* **Critical Gaps in Spirit (if applicable):** No significant gaps identified; all evidence aligns with the spirit of the control.
